This may take the form of an airways clearance on the ground at a controlled aerodrome , or airborne if transiting from uncontrolled airspace to CTA . Australia regards the following classes of airspace as controlled airspace : Class A Class C Class D Class E (for IFR aircraft, see Class E Airspace for more details) Class E Airspace In Class E Airspace, IFR aircraft require an airways clearance prior to entry. VFR aircraft, however, do not require a clearance. Instead, VFR aircraft must maintain a listening watch to the relevant ATS frequency and respond to any radio calls which are directed to them. Coded Clearances Generally, an airways clearance will specify a clearance limit, the approved route to fly, and any vertical restrictions, as well as other details (such as a squawk code and departure procedure) as required. A coded clearance is a published procedure which includes these details by default, removing the need for ATS to specify them over the radio. Coded clearances are generally defined in/out of, and surrounding, busy controlled aerodromes, or in congested controlled airspace. Details can be found in local ERSA FAC entries and Local Procedures . Example Regular Clearance : \"CYF, cleared to YSBK via HBB, SYHD, MANLY, LRF, maintain A015\" Coded Clearance : \"CYF, cleared Harbour Scenic One\" Controlled Aerodromes At a controlled aerodrome, pilots require clearance or approval to pushback, taxi, takeoff, and land from any area inside the manoeuvring area . CASA publish manoeuvring area maps on their website , showing the extent of each controller's jurisdiction. Pilots must contact the most appropriate ATS unit to obtain clearance to operate inside the manoeuvring area. Tip VATSIM employs the Top Down Rule to provide pilots with the best possible service when few controllers are online. Ensure you contact the correct controller for any aerodrome services when the aerodrome controllers themselves are not online. Frequency Transfers SMC / ADC In Australia, only international aircraft will be explicitly transferred from SMC to ADC (and vice versa). Domestic aircraft should switch to the ADC frequency without direction from SMC when approaching the instructed holding point and when ready for departure. Example AM210 is taxiing at YSSY for YBTH. They will not be explicitely transferred to ADC . SY SMC : \"AM210, cross runway 25, taxi to holding point B10, runway 34L\" AM210 : \"Cross runway 25, taxi to holding point B10, runway 34L, AM210\" As they approach the holding point, the pilot switches to the ADC frequency. AM210 : \"Sydney Tower, AM210, ready\" UAL870 is taxiing at YSSY for KLAX. They will be explicitely transferred to ADC . SY SMC : \"UAL870, cross runway 25, taxi to holding point A6, runway 34L\" UAL870 : \"Cross runway 25, taxi to holding point A6, runway 34L, UAL870\" SY SMC : \"UAL870, report ready to tower, 120.5\" UAL870 : \"120.5, UAL870\" Departures Controller An explicit frequency transfer from ADC to Departures will be given for all aircraft. This may be included with the takeoff clearance or issued after the aircraft has become airborne. Do not switch to the Departures frequency until this instruction has been issued. Pilots in receipt of an airways clearance which included a 'Departure Frequency' should switch to that frequency when they are instructed to 'contact departures' . Airport Efficiency Procedures Major aerodromes have published airport efficiency procedures which provide guidance to pilots to minimise runway occupancy and improve overall traffic capacity. Importantly, these procedures specify the preferred runway exit which pilots should plan to vacate at when landing. Pilots should plan to vacate at these exits by default, and if an alternate exit is preferred, should inform ADC on first contact. Example Any aircraft landing on runway 34L at YSSY with the intention of parking at the domestic terminal should plan to vacate at taxiway B9 . Airport efficiency procedures are published in dedicated DAP charts of the same title. Class C Major controlled aerodromes are surrounded by Class C airspace. An airways clearance is required for all operations into, out of, and in the vicinity of a Class C aerodrome. Class D Busy regional aerodromes, or smaller capital city aerodromes, are designated Class D aerodromes. An airways clearance is required for all operations in Class D airspace, however a takeoff clearance constitutes a clearance to operate within, or to leave, the Class D CTR (the airspace in contact with the ground). This means that pilots wishing to conduct circuits inside the CTR , or who wish to depart from the CTR directly into Class G airspace, will not receive an explicit airways clearance. Phraseology VH-LKU is a VFR P28A intending to depart from YSBK into Class G airspace on track to the training area. LKU : \"Bankstown Tower, Warrior LKU, holding point A8, runway 29R, upwind departure, ready\" BK ADC : \"LKU, runway 29R, cleared for takeoff\" FD213 is an IFR B350 intending to depart from YSBK into the overlying Class C airspace. FD213 : \"Bankstown Ground, FD213, to YBTH, request clearance\" BK SMC : \"FD213, cleared to YBTH via KADOM, flight planned route, BK9 departure, climb via SID to A030, squawk 3236\" FD213 : \"Cleared to YBTH via KADOM, flight planned route, BK9 departure, climb via SID to A030, squawk 3236, FD213\" Class D aerodromes include a portion of Class D airspace managed by ADC . Aircraft intending to enter the airspace from Class G must report their position and intentions to ADC prior to entering CTA . In Class D airspace, two-way communications established between ATS and the pilot constitutes a clearance to enter CTA in the manner described. Example AI9 is a VFR DA42, reporting inbound to YCFS from the south. The response by ADC establishes two-way communications, so AI9 may enter CTA direct to YCFS at A025. AI9 : \"Coffs Tower, Diamond AI9, NHS, A025, inbound, received C\" CFS ADC : \"AI9, Coffs Tower\" YPH is a VFR DA40, reporting inbound to YCFS from the north. ADC has instructed them to standby, so they must not enter CTA , as this does not establish complete two-way communications. YPH : \"Coffs Tower, Diamond YPH, WGG, A015, inbound, received C\" CFS ADC : \"YPH, Coffs Tower, standby\" Metro D Metro D aerodromes are small Class D aerodromes situated in busy terminal areas. They generally feature a small CTR with a limited lateral and vertical definition, and no overlying Class D CTA . Instead, they often sit directly below or adjacent to Class C CTA . The Class D rules described above apply to Metro D aerodromes. In addition, there are often local procedures which dictate implied frequency transfers to circuit join instructions, specified in the local ERSA FAC entry and Local Procedures . Pilots must ensure they are familiar with all local procedures prior to operating at these aerodromes. Pilot Tracking/Level Requests Whilst inside CTA , pilots must comply with the latest route clearance which they have received and maintain any assigned level. If alternate tracking or a different level is desired, this must first be requested and approved by ATS . Changes of level are common due to enroute weather, prevailing winds, or traffic, and should be requested as per Change of Level . Tracking to waypoints further along a pilot's planned route (track shortening) or to positions not on a pilot's flight plan should be requested as per Amended Route . Where bad weather presents a hazard to an aircraft, deviations around it should be requested as per Route Deviation . If a pilot wishes to conduct airwork inside CTA , this must be first requested and approved, as per Airwork . ATC Instructions Pilots must comply with any ATS -issued instructions in a timely manner. If a delay is experienced (due to aircraft malfunction or pilot competence), inform ATS so that an alternate instruction may be issued. Important VATSIM is a learning environment for both controllers and pilots, and it is expected that pilots will need a helping hand from time to time. If you do not understand an instruction or you are having trouble complying with it, don't stay quiet, speak up! Controllers can always explain themselves more clearly or provide an alternate instruction. Failure to inform the controller may result in frustration later on in the flight when their systems detect that you are off course, at the wrong level, or operating in contravention of the issued instruction. Sequencing A variety of sequencing techniques are used by controllers to ensure a smooth, efficient, predictable flow of traffic. You must comply with any sequencing or delaying instructions issued. Speed Control Generally speaking, an ATS request to 'report speed' refers to your current indicated airspeed. If a controller wishes to learn your TAS or Mach number, they will ask for these details explicitely. If you are instructed to reduce to minimum speed or increase to maximum speed (or any other variation of these speeds), you should acknowledge the instruction and comply immediately. There is no need to inform the controller of the actual achieved speed. Phraseology GUN : \"ANZ19, reduce to minimum speed\" ANZ19 : \"Reduce to minimum speeed, ANZ19\" Controllers may issue speed control for a particular phase of flight. Example \"Speed on climb 250kt or less\" Some instructions may also include self-cancelling conditions. Example \"Speed 300kt or greater until TAMMI\" Where a controller wishes to adjust your profile descent speed, they may do so by issuing an indicated airspeed to maintain on transition from the Mach range to the IAS range. This speed should be maintained in lieu of your planned descent IAS until reaching a published speed limitation. Example \"Reduce to Mach decimal 78, transition into 250kt\" Vectors Where speed control is insufficient or impractical, ATS will provide vectors to increase an aircraft's track miles and absorb any remaining delay. All heading instructions must be complied with in a timely manner and pilots must not alter their heading unless authorised by ATS . Holding If delays are excessive, ATS may issue holding instructions. When holding at a published hold (where details are available on an ERC / TAC or approach chart), the inbound course, turn direction, and timing/ DME limit specified should be used. When holding at an unpublished hold (where no details are published for that waypoint), ATS will specify these details. There are a variety of procedures specific to holds, which are covered on the Holding page. In the real world, it is common practice for pilots to be issued an onwards clearance which includes a nominated hold exit time. Pilots are responsible for ensuring they adjust their speed and the length of the pattern (with ATS approval) to pass over the holding fix at the specified time. This practice is rare online but sometimes offered to experienced pilots. Pilots in receipt of a hold exit time must cross the holding fix at up to 0 seconds late and 60 seconds early . Some airliner avionics will allow pilots to adjust the required time of departure from the fix, with the aircraft autothrottle adjusting the speed to meet the time. For aircraft not equipped with suitable automation, a simple calculation can determine the length of each outbound leg to meet the required time. Based on the current aircraft speed, determine the number of minutes to lose, then determine how long a single hold may take based on an arbitrary outbound length. Try different leg length values until the total delay becomes a multiple of the time taken for one holding pattern. Example An aircraft has been issued with an onwards clearance which results in a total delay of 12 min . The pilot may complete two holding patterns with an outbound leg time of 2 min and rate 1 turns, resulting in a total of 6 min per hold. Note that this calculation assumes that each turn will be conducted at rate 1 (and therefore take 1 min to complete a 180\u00b0 turn). If this is not the case, the calculation should be adjusted to compensate. Waypoint Crossing Times In the real world, delays which don't necessitate holding will generally be absorbed by issuing a waypoint crossing time to a pilot. The pilot will then adjust their own speed to cross the waypoint at the given time. This practice is rare online but is gaining popularity as more pilots become familiar with the procedure. Pilots in receipt of a waypoint crossing time must cross the fix at up to 0 seconds late and 30 seconds early . Complying with a crossing time is simple. Most airliners have the ability to provide a Required Time of Arrival, either through a dedicated RTA page or by editing the waypoint details on the flight plan page. Pilots of aircraft without these systems should adjust their speed (generally involving a speed reduction) until their FMS/GPS indicates the required ETA for the relevant waypoint. If the aircraft reaches minimum speed but is still too early for the assigned time, the pilot must inform ATS so that alternate delaying action can be provided. Example An aircraft has been issued an instruction to cross WELSH at time 43 . The FMS indicates that the aircraft will currently reach WELSH at time 38. To comply with the time, the pilot should reduce speed (to not below minimum speed) until the FMS ETA for WELSH changes to 43. Given that the accepted window for the crossing time is 0 seconds late and up to 30 seconds early, the pilot should then increase speed slightly so that the FMS indicates an ETA of 42. This way, they can be sure that they are in the 30 seconds prior to time 43. Separation Standards Different classes of airspace have different operating requirements from pilots and services provided by ATS . This is explained in detail on the Airspace Overview page. As a summary, pilots can expect the following separation standards to be applied to them in CTA . Airspace Class IFR VFR SVFR A Separated from all aircraft - - C Separated from all aircraft Separated from IFR , traffic info on other aircraft Separated from SVFR (where visibility is less than VMC ), traffic info on other aircraft D Separated from IFR and SVFR , traffic info on VFR Traffic info on all aircraft Separated from SVFR (where visibility is less than VMC ), traffic info on other aircraft E Separated from IFR , traffic info on other aircraft Traffic info on all aircraft - G Traffic info on all aircraft Traffic info on all aircraft (only if receiving SIS ) - Visual Separation In some situations, a separation standard must be maintained between two aircraft, but doing so would result in a delay for one or more pilots. In these situations, ATS may delegate separation responsibility to the pilot, using visual separation. Visual separation responsibility will only be issued to a pilot when both aircraft are operating at or below A100 and the pilot reports: - that they have the other aircraft in sight, and - that they can maintain visual separation with the aircraft The delegation of separation responsibility does not authorise a pilot to manoeuvre in contradiction of their authorised clearance. If alternate tracking is required, pilots must still request this and await ATS approval. Phraseology RSCU203 is a VFR helicopter who wishes to depart from Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, which sits directly under the YSSY RWY 16L approach path. SY ADC : \"RSCU203, report sighting a Jetstar A320 on a 6nm final RWY 16L\" RSCU203: \"Traffic sighted, RSCU203\" SY ADC : \"RSCU203, are you able to maintain own separation with the Jetstar A320?\" RSCU203: \"Affirm, RSCU203\" SY ADC : \"RSCU203, maintain own separation with the Jetstar A320, caution wake turbulence, report airborne\" RSCU203: \"Maintain own separation with the Jetstar A320, wilco, RSCU203\"","title":"Controlled Airspace"},{"location":"airspace/cta/#airways-clearances","text":"An airways clearance must be obtained before entering CTA by contacting the relevant ATS unit responsible for the airspace.

However, the network is a place of learning for both controllers and pilots, and it is unreasonable to expect a 1:1 service. Pilots should reference real world documents and charts but be prepared for some inconsistencies and discrepancies to exist. The procedures detailed on this site (particularly the Local Procedures ) have been designed to compliment VATPAC's ATC SOPs . Radio Communication As per the VATSIM Code of Conduct, pilots operating OCTA (or without any ATC online) must monitor the appropriate advisory frequency and make radio broadcasts as deemed necessary. In practice, this translates to making all CTAF radio calls on the advisory frequency. The VATSIM advisory frequency is 122.800 . Pilots should be aware of the existence of both voice-capable and text-only pilots, and consider making broadcasts via both voice and text where appropriate. Some pilots may not be using real-world weather or time of day, so pilots should be alert to aircraft using reciprocal or crossing runways, or flying different approaches, at uncontrolled aerodromes. Top Down Rule VATSIM employs a 'top down' rule, whereby controllers may (and in some cases, are expected to) provide a level of coverage to terminal areas and controlled aerodromes within their jurisdiction. This provides a greater service level to pilots but may cause some minor confusion for new members. Tools like VATSIM Radar and the VATPAC Map display all online controllers. Any major controlled aerodromes which fit inside these sectors can be assumed to have top down coverage, with the overlying controller performing the roles of ADC and SMC / ACD if applicable. Example The controller above is logged on as HYD (Melbourne Centre enroute position) which overlays the Perth terminal area and YPPH. Aircraft on the ground at YPPH should contact HYD for airways clearance and all subsequent calls. Pilots should contact the lowest applicable controller as they move up from the aerodrome level to enroute. Example GUN and Sydney ADC are both online. A pilot on the ground at YSSY wishing to obtain airways clearance would contact SY ADC , as they are the lowest controller over Sydney. Zulu ATISes A Zulu ATIS ( ATIS with code Z ) may be published by controllers to indicate that an aerodrome which can be temporarily activated is currently uncontrolled . Pilots of IFR aircraft should contact the overlying controller prior to taxi to commence their SARWATCH service. Pilots should refer to Local Procedures to determine whether any special procedures apply to the aerodrome, but may otherwise taxi and depart at their own discretion. A Zulu ATIS for YSTW Enroute Sector Extensions Enroute controllers have the option of extending from their primary log on position to other adjacent sectors. When this is the case, they will use an appropriate means to notify surrounding controllers and pilots. Each controller has a short remark, called a Controller ATIS , associated with their session. The majority of controllers will publish their sector extensions in their Controller ATIS . Mapping tools like VATSIM Radar and the VATPAC Map will automatically display these extended sectors. Top Down rules apply to any major, controlled aerodromes contained inside an extended sector. KEN extending to ISA and INL Important Some older mapping tools do not display extended sectors correctly (or at all). Pilots are strongly encouraged to use VATSIM Radar or the VATPAC Map to ensure they have the most up-to-date information at hand, and can comply with their obligations under the VATSIM Code of Conduct at all times.

Pilots should be aware of the existence of both voice-capable and text-only pilots, and consider making broadcasts via both voice and text where appropriate. Some pilots may not be using real-world weather or time of day, so pilots should be alert to aircraft using reciprocal or crossing runways, or flying different approaches, at uncontrolled aerodromes.","title":"Radio Communication"},{"location":"airspace/vatsimoperations/#top-down-rule","text":"VATSIM employs a 'top down' rule, whereby controllers may (and in some cases, are expected to) provide a level of coverage to terminal areas and controlled aerodromes within their jurisdiction. This provides a greater service level to pilots but may cause some minor confusion for new members. Tools like VATSIM Radar and the VATPAC Map display all online controllers. Any major controlled aerodromes which fit inside these sectors can be assumed to have top down coverage, with the overlying controller performing the roles of ADC and SMC / ACD if applicable. Example The controller above is logged on as HYD (Melbourne Centre enroute position) which overlays the Perth terminal area and YPPH. Aircraft on the ground at YPPH should contact HYD for airways clearance and all subsequent calls. Pilots should contact the lowest applicable controller as they move up from the aerodrome level to enroute. Example GUN and Sydney ADC are both online. A pilot on the ground at YSSY wishing to obtain airways clearance would contact SY ADC , as they are the lowest controller over Sydney.","title":"Top Down Rule"},{"location":"airspace/vatsimoperations/#zulu-atises","text":"A Zulu ATIS ( ATIS with code Z ) may be published by controllers to indicate that an aerodrome which can be temporarily activated is currently uncontrolled .

Top Down rules apply to any major, controlled aerodromes contained inside an extended sector.

Fork the project into your personal account on GitHub. Create a new branch from main , with a clear name of what you're implementing - seen in the image on the right. Checkout your new branch, and commit some changes. Open a new Pull Request for your changes/branch. This can be done by heading to the sops repository, and finding Pull requests Click on the green button, saying New pull request Make note of the arrow! In the image to the left, you can see that the arrow shows that we're wanting to merge this-is-a-test-branch into main . After making sure the arrows are correct, click on the green Create pull request button. Make sure your title clearly explains the changes you've made, but is still concise. Fill out the main content of your PR as necessary. The main content of your PR serves as the project tracker for that feature or fix.

In the real world, there are many reasons why an alternate may need to be carried. This page simplifies some of the real world rules and highlights the ones which are applicable for VATSIM operations. Any alternate you nominate must not, itself, require an alternate. Alternate due Weather When planning a flight, make careful study of your destination's TAF and take note of the cloud, visibility, and wind during the period of 30 minutes either side of your ETA (60 minute window). Compare the forecast values with the alternate minima described below. If a TAF is not available for your arrival window, you must hold an alternate. You must plan an alternate (or carry sufficient holding fuel, see Fuel Planning ) if: There is more than scattered cloud below the alternate minima, or The visibility is less than the alternate minima, or The wind (including any gusts) exceed the aircraft's crosswind or tailwind limitations, or The forecast indicates thunderstorms or their associated severe turbulence Note When calculating the amount of cloud at a given level, the following rules apply: FEW plus FEW equals SCT FEW plus SCT equals BKN Tip You can access TAFs and METARs for your departure & destination airports (as well as all available charts) using VATPAC's Pilot Assist tool. VFR Alternate Minima The VFR alternate minima, by both day and night, is as follows: Cloud Visibility 1,500ft AGL 8km For helicopters operated under Day VFR to an uncontrolled (Class G) aerodrome, the alternate minima is reduced to: Cloud Visibility 1,000ft AGL 3km Note An alternate is not required if you are flying under Day VFR and plan to remain within 50nm of the departure aerodrome. IFR Alternate Minima The IFR alternate minima is described on any approach chart for that aerodrome. The figures are formatted as cloud height above ground level and visibility in kilometres. Example An alternate would be required for a Category C aircraft landing at Adelaide (YPAD) with more than scattered cloud below 1,480ft AGL and/or visibility below 6.0km . Adelaide Alternate Minima (example only, not for operational use) Note See Aircraft Categories below to determine your aircraft's category. If your destination does not have an instrument approach, you must plan an alternate if the forecast indicates weather conditions below: Cloud Visibility LSALT +500ft 8km Alternate due Navaids IFR An alternate must be held for IFR flights if due to the aircraft's equipment or the destination aerodrome's navigation aids, a single point of failure in the aircraft or on the ground would cause a loss of approach capability. In practice, this means that if your destination has only a single approach type available or your aircraft has only a single piece of equipment which can receive that data, you must carry an alternate. Example Flying a King Air (with a single GNSS , and multiple VHF NAV & ADF equipment onboard) to Orange (YORG), which has published RNP approaches but no ground based aids, would require an alternate, as a loss of RAIM or GNSS integrity would result in the aircraft being unable to conduct an approach. Flying a C172 (with a single GNSS and a single VHF NAV) to Sydney (YSSY) would not require an alternate, as a failure of a single piece of equipment in the aircraft (e.g. the GPS) or on the ground (e.g. the ILS ) would not prevent the aircraft from conducting an approach (they could still utilise the RNP or ILS approach, depending on the source of failure). Night VFR An alternate, within 1 hour flying time, is required for Night VFR flights unless: The aircraft is equipped with GNSS , or The destination is served by a ground-based navaid which the aircraft has equipment to receive Aircraft Categories Aircraft are grouped into categories for the purpose of flight planning and terminal procedure design.

The bottom of the layer is bordered by the transition altitude and the top of the layer is bordered by the transition level . As pilots climb through the transition altitude, they should set their altimeters to the standard altimeter setting of 1013 hPa. Modern avionics generally provide a STD function to facilitate this. As pilots descend through the transition level, they should set their altimeters to the most appropriate QNH setting (generally their destination aerodrome QNH, or area QNH if local QNH is not available). Cruise Level Availability Cruising at a level inside the transition layer is not permitted. In Australia, the transition altitude is fixed at 10,000ft AMSL . The transition level varies with QNH, as per below: Flight Level Availability FL110 Not available when QNH is below 1013 hPa FL115 Not available when QNH is below 997 hPa FL120 Not available when QNH is below 980 hPa FL125 Not available when QNH is below 963 hPa As a result, levels up to F125 may not always be available for aircraft to cruise at. Example The area QNH is 991 hPa. As a result, the transition layer extends between A100 and F120, and levels between them are not available for cruising. Area QNH Area QNH is a forecast QNH value covering a wide geographical area. A number of area QNH zones are published (visible on the PCA ) with forecast QNH values published for each. Where large pressure gradients create varying QNH in a zone, it is subdivided so that the published area QNH value is always no more than 5 hPa difference from neighbouring area QNH or local QNH values. Area QNH values can be obtained from the BOM website or requested from ATS . Example TEK : \"Melbourne Centre, TEK is 15nm southeast of YGTH, request area QNH\" MUN : \"TEK, area QNH 1024\" TEK : \"Area QNH 1024, TEK\" Altimeter Setting on the Ground On the ground, local QNH should be set with reference to the ATIS or AWIS . At landing areas without any published weather information, the QNH can be determined by adjusting the altimeter subscale until the instrument reads the current elevation. Instrument Approach Corrections The minima published on most Airservices Australia instrument approach charts assumes the use of forecast QNH from the aerodrome's TAF . This caters for the unlikely situation where a pilot finds themselves unable to obtain actual weather information while inbound to land. However, in the vast majority of cases, this weather information is available, so the minima must be corrected. For charts with grey, shaded minima boxes , the quoted minima altitude should be reduced by 100ft when using actual QNH (from an ATIS or AWIS ). Major aerodromes (such as YSSY and YMML) assume that actual QNH will always be available, so the minima boxes on those approach charts are not shaded, and no correction should be applied. Shaded minima boxes at YMER (example only, not for operational use) Where both actual QNH and forecast QNH are not available, pilots can use area QNH to set their altimeters for the approach.

A flight plan is not required for local aerodrome operations like circuits. Tip ATS can create a flight plan for you if required, however this will involve detailing all aspects of your aircraft and intended flight over the radio. In the majority of cases, it is simplier to file a flight plan yourself. Callsigns When filing and connecting as an aircraft belonging to an established operator (such as an airline), pilots should use the three letter ICAO operator prefix, not the two letter IATA code. Example To connect as a Qantas aircraft, the three letter ICAO identifier QFA should be used, not the two letter ICAO code QF . Any ICAO operator callsign can be used. A list of further approved callsigns (including local aeromedical, general aviation, and Defence callsigns) is available in Radio Telephony . Tip If you are using a callsign which is foreign to Australia (or refers to a virtual airline or other lesser known operator), the actual callsign name should be included in your flight plan remarks . When connecting as a general aviation aircraft (or operating the aircraft using its registration as your callsign), remove the hyphen which separates the registration prefix and suffix. The 'VH' prefix should only be included for flights outside of Australian territory. Example When operating VH-CYF wholly within Australian territory, the callsign CYF would be used (and filed on your flight plan). When operating outside of, entering, or leaving Australian territory, the callsign VHCYF would be used and filed. Aircraft Type The full ICAO aircraft type code should be used on a flight plan. Example A Boeing 747-400 would file using the aircraft type B744 . EOBT The estimated off-blocks time field is used by ATS software to order all submitted flight plans and aids controllers in estimating future workload. Additionally, invalid or nonsensical EOBT times may result in your flight plan being hidden from controllers due to the system assuming it is irrelevant. Ensure that an appropriate EOBT is filed. Where unforeseen delays occur prior to departure, consider contacting the relevant ATS unit to amend your EOBT. Example VOZ1252 : \"Sydney Delivery, VOZ1252, we'll be a bit delayed tonight, would you mind updating our EOBT to 0930?\" Unrecognised Landing Areas If your departure or destination does not have a recognised ICAO code, replace it with ZZZZ and include a remark with the position of the landing area. It is good practice to include an additional remark detailing the name of the landing area, for use on the radio if required. The format of your remarks field is important. Ensure that you use the format shown below: Remark Abbreviation Meaning DEP/<position> Position of departure aerodrome/landing area DEST/<position> Position of destination aerodrome/landing area See Custom Waypoints for details on how to format custom positions. Example Departure : ZZZZ Remarks : DEP/2730S15327E RMK/2730S15327E IS DUSTBOWL STATION Equipment Codes The equipment and transponder codes you file in your flight plan will impact how ATS process your navigation requirements, and control how you appear on their radar scope. Equipment codes refer to the navigational equipment your aircraft is equipped with. Transponder codes refer to the type of transponder and ADS-B system installed in your aircraft. A full list of equipment codes can be obtained through various online sources (searching for ICAO equipment codes - not FAA), with the most commonly used summarised below: Equipment Code Explanation D DME E1 FMC with ACARS F ADF G GNSS L ILS O VOR S Standard - ILS , VOR , VHF T TACAN W RVSM Example An aircraft equipped with GNSS , ILS , VOR , DME , and ADF receivers, VHF comms, and RVSM -compliant altimeters would file SDFGW .

You should not include plain English items. Wrong Route : VFR COASTAL Correct Route : DCT (or any other approximate known waypoint names) Remarks : COASTAL FLYING Whatever route you file in your flight plan must match what you load into your aircraft's FMS/GPS. Additionally, the route field should not include the departure and destination aerodrome codes, as these have dedicated fields. Tip A common mistake made by pilots conducting circuits at an aerodrome is to file a flight plan containing the route CCT (or similar). ATS software converts the route into known waypoints and draws a route to Central City, USA, flagging the flight plan for all controllers along the way. For circuits, a flight plan is generally not required, however if a pilot wishes to file one, they should file a route of DCT and include a remark indicating their intention to conduct circuits. Custom Waypoints Custom waypoints can be included in your route by referencing lat/long positions or bearing/distance information from a known waypoint. Lat/long positions should take the format of: DDHHCDDHHC , where: DD = Degrees HH = Hours C = Cardinal direction (i.e. N, S, E, W) Example The position -32.7957, 151.8407 would be expressed as 3247S15150E . Positions can also be expressed with reference to a known position, using the format: WPTBBBDDD , where: WPT = Known waypoint code BBB = Bearing outbound from the known waypoint (as a three digit number) DDD = Distance from the known waypoint (as a three digit number) Example A position 25nm on the 045 bearing (northeast) from YSSY would be expressed as YSSY045025 . Remarks Airwork and Planned Delays During training or special operation flights, it may be necessary to conduct airwork at a predetermined position before continuing on your flight planned route. This should be indicated using the DLE/ format. Additionally, for practice instrument approaches or coded clearances, a remark should be included to dictate this request.

Filing a priority status in your flight plan will not result in being prioritised above other aircraft (contrary to the real world), however it may signal ATS to provide track shortening or to facilitate your planned operations. Radio Callsign Where an unusual or non-standard callsign has been filed (see Callsigns ), include the full radio callsign in your remarks using the RTF/ format.

The sections below outline the categories of fuel which may be required. A sample fuel plan is included to highlight the practical use of each fuel category. Trip Fuel Trip fuel (also called Flight Fuel) is the amount of fuel you expect to burn to fly your planned route, including an allowance for climb and descent if required. It is generally calculated by dividing your route distance by your expected ground speed (accounting for forecast wind). Reserve Fuel Reserve fuel is an allowance which helps cater for anything which may increase the flight fuel (such as unforecast headwinds) and provides a safety margin in case an unexpected event results in a fuel emergency. It is broken up into Final Reserve fuel and Contingency fuel. In the real world, reserve fuel rules are divided into aircraft category and weight class. The following table simplifies these rules for VATSIM use. Aircraft Type Flight Rules Final Reserve Contingency Fuel Piston engine or small turboprop Day VFR 30 min Piston engine or small turboprop Night VFR or IFR 45 min Jet engine or commuter turboprop VFR or IFR 30 min 5% of flight & alternate fuel Helicopter VFR 20 min Helicopter IFR 30 min Contingency fuel is designed to be used, to cater for unexpected headwinds, unusual fuel burns, or other small factors which may impact overall fuel usage. Final Reserve fuel is designed as a safety buffer and should not be used. It is a requirement that you land with your Final Reserve fuel intact. See Inflight Fuel Emergencies for what is required when you expect to have to use your Final Reserve fuel. Taxi Fuel Taxi fuel is required to cater for the fuel required to taxi to the runway for departure, and to the gate after landing. It may also include a fuel allowance to run the APU. The actual burn rate will depend on the aircraft. Instrument Approach Fuel Instrument approaches often involve configuring the aircraft earlier than normal and tracking via points not planned to originally. As such, extra fuel must be carried when an instrument approach is expected. The exact amount of fuel depends on the aircraft you are flying, but as a general rule of thumb, allowing 10-15 min at the normal burn rate is normally sufficient. Approach fuel is only required when the weather indicates an instrument approach will be required to land. This is generally indicated by the following meteorological minima: Cloud Visibility Any cloud below LSALT +500ft Less than 8km Weather Holding/Alternate Fuel Where the weather (or other factors) are expected to be unsuitable, sufficient fuel must be carried to either hold until conditions improve or divert to a suitable alternate aerodrome. See Alternate Requirements for more information. If the weather is forecast to be below the alternate minima, an alternate must be carried. If the poor weather is associated with an INTER or TEMPO , holding fuel must be carried to wait until conditions improve, in accordance with the table below. Term Description Holding Fuel Required INTER Intermittent period lasting up to 30 minutes 30 min TEMPO Temporary period lasting up to 60 minutes 60 min If a forecast indicates a probability ( PROB30 or PROB40 ) of poor weather below the alternate minima, you must assume that the weather will eventuate, and hold an alternate or carry holding fuel as required. Example Alternate minima : cloud base of 1,200ft and visibility of 5km TAF (snippet) : PROB30 INTER 0312/0318 4000 SHOWERS OF MODERATE RAIN BKN010 Fuel Required : 30 min weather holding fuel (if ETA falls between 1130z and 1830z) Traffic Holding Fuel Traffic holding fuel is required when operating into certain busy aerodromes. In the real world, traffic levels are consistent and planned, whereas on VATSIM, traffic levels are variable and often unpredictable. Real world traffic holding requirements are found in an aerodrome's ERSA FAC entry. On VATSIM, it is more important to carry traffic holding fuel during busy events. Regular events, like Milk Run Monday, Panic Stations, and WorldFlight, where high traffic levels are expected, require additional holding fuel to cater for enroute delaying action (such as vectors, holds, and extended periods of time at lower altitudes). The amount of fuel required is left up to the pilot, but as a general rule, regular events like Milk Run Monday require roughly 20 min of holding fuel, whereas more renowned events like WorldFlight may require up to 90 min. If in doubt, carry a little extra. Extra Fuel The pilot in command may dictate any extra fuel they wish to carry and it is their responsibility to ensure that the fuel onboard is sufficient to complete the flight. If you believe that extra fuel is required for any reason, you must carry that fuel. There are other situations where you may wish to carry extra fuel, including fuel tankering (carrying enough fuel for the return leg) or when flying to an isolated aerodrome with minimal suitable divert points. It is also worth remembering that you will be sharing the airspace with pilots of all competency levels, which may result in unexpected go arounds or approaches, so extra fuel may be required to compensate. Example Fuel Plan Below are several sample fuel plans for various aircraft types. These are provided as an example of how to utilise each category of fuel described above. The burn rates and described fuel figures are examples only and should not be used in an operational sense.

In these cases, an inflight fuel plan should be done to determine the minimum amount of fuel required to divert to a suitable alternate (either nominated during preflight planning or determined then and there). Once a suitable alternate has been found, determine the flight fuel required to get there, any weather, traffic, or other holding requirements it may have, whether an approach will be required, and any other fuel you may need. Add your required reserves to determine your calculated minimum fuel, then apply a conservative buffer. By assessing your current fuel state and actual burn rate, you can determine how much time you have remaining in the hold before you must divert. It is important to keep ATC in the loop when approaching your divert time and ensure you start tracking for your alternate without delay. If your fuel state deteriorates further, you may need to advise ATC as per Inflight Fuel Emergencies below. Example Aircraft : SAAB 340 Flight Rules : IFR Alternate Weather : Good, with an INTER below the alternate minima Category Amount Flight Fuel to Alternate 219 kg Final Reserve 225 kg Contingency Fuel 22 kg Weather Holding 225 kg (30 min) Traffic Holding Instrument Approach Extra Fuel Total Fuel Required 691 kg Minimum Fuel with Buffer 750 kg Fuel Onboard : 1,050 kg Current Fuel Burn : 350 kg/hr The aircraft can remain in the hold for another 51 minutes before a diversion becomes necessary. Inflight Fuel Emergencies As explained in Reserve Fuel , you are required to land with your Final Reserve fuel intact (untouched). During the course of normal operations, this should not be a problem. If, through poor planning or unexpected enroute delays, you are expecting to land with less than your Final Reserve fuel onboard, you must notify ATC, as per below. See Radio Telephony - Emergency for notes on how to communicate these emergencies over the radio. Minimum Fuel You must declare MINIMUM FUEL to ATC when you are informed of a delay which will result in you using all of the holding fuel you have onboard. This means that the current delay will not result in you landing with less than your Final Reserve fuel onboard, but any additional delay will. In response to a declaration of MINIMUM FUEL, you will not receive any priority from ATC, however you will be informed of any expected additional delay. Mayday Fuel You must declare MAYDAY FUEL when you determine that you will be landing with less than your Fixed Reserve onboard. The declaration of MAYDAY FUEL constitutes an emergency and you will receive priority from ATC to enable you to land as soon as possible.","title":"Fuel Planning"},{"location":"flight-planning/fuelplanning/#preflight-fuel-planning","text":"Before departing, it is critical that you ensure the fuel on board is sufficient for your intended flight, including any required reserve or holding fuel.

However, if you are planning to enter CTA or visit a major aerodrome, careful route selection will make it considerably easier for ATC to clear you as requested. A number of third-party tools exist to help with route selection but each have shortcomings and limitations, so it's helpful to be aware of how to perform this task manually. VFR Route Selection When operating VFR , you are required to determine your position with a visual fix every 30 minutes (see VFR Navigation for more info), so it is important that you plan your route with enough identifiable landmarks to allow frequent visual fixes. Using a VTC , VNC , or WAC (available on the Airservices Australia website), plot your departure and destination airports, then assess any route requirements to remain clear of obstacles, CTA , or PRDs . From there, select a route which will provide easy visual navigation, with frequent landmarks (such as mountain peaks, lakes, river junctions, towns, racetracks, etc) on and either side of your planned track. Also look for lead-in features which will aid in the early recognition of each landmark. When operating near CTA or PRDs , apply a conservative lateral buffer or plan a level which remains clear of the boundary. If ATC see you tracking towards airspace without a clearance, they're likely to send you a 'contact me' request. If you plan to enter or transit CTA , especially around major Class C aerodromes, plan a backup route which remains OCTA , in case an airways clearance is unavailable. IFR Route Selection IFR flights are generally planned along pre-defined airways, joining ground-based navaids or RNAV waypoints together along surveyed paths. This provides pilots with terrain/obstacle clearance assurance and helps manage traffic in busy terminal areas by defining a designated inbound and outbound track. Some airways are designated as one-way tracks, while others allow traffic to utilise it in both directions. Pilots should use an ERC in conjunction with a TAC around major aerodromes to determine the best route. For operations at or below FL200, use the ERC -L (low). Operations above FL200 should use the ERC -H (high). Some remote aerodromes aren't serviced by airways, so it may be desirable to plan direct to an appropriate fix instead. When planning a route, consider any airspace requirements (particularly when operating to, from, or in the vicinity of major aerodromes) and ensure you comply with the ERSA Flight Planning Requirements as detailed below. Also consider the terrain you'll be flying over. During the winter months, icing can become a serious threat to aircraft without ice protection equipment and an alternate route may need to be planned to avoid areas of high terrain, allowing the aircraft to operate in the warmer air at lower altitudes. Each degree of latitude/longitude on an ERC -L is divided into a grid, and a Grid LSALT is published for each square denoting the lowest safe altitude for operations in that area. Pilots can use these Grid LSALTs to ensure they'll remain above any limiting obstacles/terrain, even if they need to deviate off their planned route. ERSA Flight Planning Requirements The ERSA Flight Planning Requirements (FPR) document lists required tracking points and vertical restrictions which help manage traffic flow into and out of busy aerodromes. Ensure that your planned route complies with any restrictions imposed by the FPR. If your planned departure and destination aerodrome (or initial tracking points) are not listed in the document, you can assume that no planning requirements apply. In this case, plan a route in accordance with the advice above to respect any one-way airways or other planning requirements. Tip If the required route listed in the FPR is undesirable (e.g. it adds significant track miles) and the weather is suitable, consider departing VFR or remaining OCTA until you are outside the terminal area. Altitude Selection Appropriate level selection depends on your flight rules, route, and intention to enter or remain clear of CTA . For IFR , determine the highest LSALT out of the airways you've selected or the Grid LSALT , if not flying via airways for your entire route. For VFR , identify the highest obstacles/terrain and select a level which provides a safe buffer (generally 500ft, or 1000ft if above a populated area) above. Grid LSALTs (circled) over Flinders Island for each green grid square Next, adjust your chosen level to comply with the hemispherical level rule. IFR flights should plan an odd level (e.g. 7,000ft) when flying east and an even level (e.g. 8,000ft) when flying west, up to 41,000ft. VFR flights should comply with this rule, but add 500ft to the determined level. A full list of available altitudes is replicated below: IFR - Track 000 to 179 IFR - Track 180 to 359 3,000ft 2,000ft 5,000ft 4,000ft 7,000ft 6,000ft 9,000ft 8,000ft FL110 10,000ft FL130 FL120 FL150 FL140 FL170 FL160 FL190 FL180 FL210 FL200 FL230 FL220 FL250 FL240 FL270 FL260 FL290 FL280 FL310 FL300 FL330 FL320 FL350 FL340 FL370 FL360 FL390 FL380 FL410 FL400 FL450 FL430 FL490 FL470 FL510 VFR - Track 000 to 179 VFR - Track 180 to 359 3,500ft 2,500ft 5,500ft 4,500ft 7,500ft 6,500ft 9,500ft 8,500ft FL115 10,500ft FL135 FL125 FL155 FL145 FL175 FL165 FL195 FL185 FL215 FL205 FL235 FL225 FL245 Note When planning to operate VFR outside CTA at 3,000ft AMSL or below, you may select any desired altitude without regard for the table above. Tip These rules apply to pilots at the flight planning stage. Once airborne, you may request climb to non-standard levels, subject to surrounding traffic and ATC requirements. Use of Third-Party Tools Flight planning can be greatly simplified through the use of the many available third-party tools, although caution should be taken when utilising them. SimBrief is a popular site designed to automate route selection and fuel planning. Pay extra attention when selecting a route from the suggested list, as they may have been submitted by users with little flight planning experience. It is good practice to confidence check the suggested route against another source, and where available, select the purple 'Preferred Route' (which have been uploaded by VATPAC staff). It is also recommended that you add extra fuel (using the built-in input boxes) where required, as per Fuel Planning . VATPAC's Pilot Assist tool can be helpful for generating weather forecasts and accessing charts for your planned flight. The system can also be used to generate a route which complies with the ERSA FPR. Some aerodromes and terminal areas feature specific procedures for pilots to comply with. These procedures have been summarised in Local Procedures , where you'll find flight planning advice as well as in-flight procedural guidelines. Applications like Navigraph allow pilots to plot out their intended flight plan on appropriate maps and charts. For those without a subscription, the free SkyVector provides similar functionality. Be aware that the system is primarily designed for use in the USA and whilst Australian coverage is generally good, the VFR mapping system is lacking compared to other options.","title":"Route Selection"},{"location":"flight-planning/routeselection/#vfr-route-selection","text":"When operating VFR , you are required to determine your position with a visual fix every 30 minutes (see VFR Navigation for more info), so it is important that you plan your route with enough identifiable landmarks to allow frequent visual fixes.

Refer to the relevant chart and be aware of the tight turn from base to final. Careful planning and speed control is necessary to avoid overshooting final. Preferred Runway Exits The AIRPORT EFFICIENCY PROCEDURES chart dictates preferred runway exits for pilots to vacate at. This ensures a predictable, efficient movement of aircraft on the aerodrome and should be abided by where possible. Where a preferred exit is not assured, pilots must inform ADC . Runway Aircraft Type Preferred Exits RWY 09 Turboprop Other A P, otherwise Q RWY 16 All G, otherwise E or J RWY 27 All Heavy N M RWY 34 All F, otherwise E or C LAHSO LAHSO is the independent operation of two crossing runways for arrivals and departures. It is a complicated procedure which is rarely used, but occassionally run during VATPAC's busiest events featuring YMML. Strict pilot requirements apply during LAHSO . The active aircraft is the landing aircraft issued with a hold short instruction, prohibiting them from rolling out on their assigned runway beyond the intersection with the crossing runway. The passive aircraft is the landing or departing aircraft which has full use of their assigned runway. YMML operates LAHSO using RWY 27 as the passive runway and RWY 34 as the active runway. Pilot Requirements All Australian registered aircraft operating under a flight number callsign are assumed to be approved active participants .

a major threat to VFR flight and can impact the operational capability of IFR aircraft. They also bring secondary risks including icing, turbulence, and thunderstorm activity. Cloud Cover Cloud cover is described by oktas , or how many eighths of the visible sky is obscured. Description Meaning Sky Clear (SKC) 0 /8 of the sky obscured Few (FEW) 1-2 /8 of the sky obscured Scattered (SCT) 3-4 /8 of the sky obscured Broken (BKN) 5-7 /8 of the sky obscured Overcast (OVC) 8 /8 of the sky obscured Tip VFR navigation is considered impractical above more than 4 oktas of cloud coverage. Area forecasts may describe the frequency of cumulonimbus clouds using the following scale: Description Meaning Isolated (ISOL) Individual clouds Occasional (OCNL) Well-separated clouds Frequent (FRQ) Clouds with little (or no) separation Types Generally, rain-producing clouds are prefixed or suffixed with nimbo (e.g. nimbostratus and cumulonimbus). Cumulo clouds are generally heaped, vertical arrangements which are frequently associated with turbulence (e.g. cumulus and stratocumulus). Layered clouds are generally prefixed or suffixed with strato (e.g. altostratus and cirrostratus) and form large sheets of cloud with little vertical development. For ease of use on weather reports and forecasts, each cloud type is abbreviated to a two character term. Abbreviation Cloud Type Height Description Ci Cirrus High Detatched, delicate filaments Cc Cirrocumulus High Thin layer made up of many small ripples or grains Cs Cirrostratus High Transparent veil covering most of the sky, creates a sun halo Ac Altocumulus Mid Layer of rounded masses made up of smaller particles As Altostratus Mid Grey layer covering most of the sky, no halo Ns Nimbostratus Mid Thick, grey, uniform layer with continuous preciptation Sc Stratocumulus Low Layer of large rolls or masses St Stratus Low Grey, fairly uniform layer with drizzle Cu Cumulus Low Groups of detatched, towering, dense clouds Cb Cumulonimbus All Heavy, dense, towering thunderstorm cells Vertical Visibility Where weather phenomena (e.g. smoke or raised dust) obscures the sky but does not form cloud, the vertical visibility will be reported. This can be treated as an overcast layer of cloud at that level. Example A SPECI which contains vv009 would indicate vertical visibility of 900ft AAL . Visibility Along with cloud, low visibility also poses a major threat to all forms of aviation. Low visibility is generally caused by precipitation, fog/mist, or other airborne particles such as bushfire smoke or dust storms. Fog is cloud which touches the surface and reduces visibility below 1,000m. Mist is fog which reduces visibility to not less than 1,000m. Both fog and mist (and low cloud in general) are likely to form when the temperature and dew point are close together, increasing the relative humidity. Pilots can generally extrapolate the likelihood of fog by comparing the temperature and dew point split on a METAR . Wind Wind is described by the direction from which it blows. Example Wind reported as 210/15 blows from the southwest to the northeast at 15kt. Aircraft travelling southwest would have a headwind while aircraft travelling northeast would have a tailwind. Surface Winds Surface winds play a major role in determining the duty runway at an aerodrome, as aircraft generally aim to takeoff and land into wind. Failing to do so can expose the aircraft to large crosswind components (which may make keeping fixed wing aircraft travelling straight difficult) or tailwind components (which increases the GS of an aircraft for a given TAS and requires more runway length to operate from). Additionally, due to the aerodynamic effect of recirculating turbulent air through the rotor system, some helicopters have a maximum tailwind/crosswind speed in which they can hover. Wind information can be sourced from published reports, ATIS / AWIS stations, or by looking at the windsock. When operating at landing areas without reported weather information, environmental elements such as trees, blowing smoke, and bodies of water can indicate the wind direction. Enroute Winds Enroute winds impact navigation , requiring the aircraft's heading to be adjusted to compensate for any crosswind component (and maintain the track made good along the ground). Additionally, headwind or tailwind components will impact the time taken to fly a particular leg, requiring an adjustment in trip fuel . Air Pressure Air pressure has a moderate impact on aircraft performance. At lower pressure (generally found at higher altitudes), air density is reduced, which leads to a reduction in power from aircraft engines and a reduction in thrust from propellers/rotor blades. Pressure Altitude Pilots can calculate the effect of operating at low pressures by applying a correction to their current elevation. This represents the altitude in the standard atmosphere where an air mass of that pressure would be found (uncorrected for temperature) and is called the Pressure Altitude. A variety of resources exist online to perform this calculation. Temperature Temperature has a major impact on aircraft performance. At higher temperatures, air density is reduced, which leads to a reduction in power from aircraft engines and a reduction in thrust from propellers/rotor blades. Air temperature can be measured a number of ways, however for aviation, it is commonly described as OAT . Density Altitude Pilots can calculate the effect of operating at high temperatures by applying a correction to their calculated pressure altitude . This represents the altitude in the standard atmosphere where air of that density would be found and is called the Density Altitude. A variety of resources exist online to perform this calculation. International Standard Atmosphere A set of standard atmospheric conditions have been established to create a baseline for all performance-driven data in aviation. It is often necessary to correct from the standard atmosphere to determine the effect the current atmospheric conditions will have on aircraft performance. The standard MSL atmospheric conditions are: Element Value Temperature 15\u00b0C Temperature Lapse Rate 2\u00b0C per 1,000ft of altitude (until the tropopause at 36,000ft) Air Pressure 1013 hPa In addition to calculating actual aircraft performance (based on relevant aircraft performance charts), the values above can be used to estimate the temperature at a particular altitude which may assist in the assessment of enroute icing conditions . Weather Information At controlled aerodromes, weather information is generally sourced from the ATIS . At uncontrolled aerodromes, weather information is generally available on the AWIS . At landing areas without any published weather information, the QNH can be determined by adjusting the altimeter subscale until the instrument reads the current elevation. Wind direction can be determined by assessing surrounding environmental factors .","title":"Aviation Meteorology"},{"location":"meteorology/aviationmet/#cloud","text":"Clouds (and their associated lack of inflight visibility) pose a major threat to VFR flight and can impact the operational capability of IFR aircraft.

Large thunderstorms can create strong microbursts with downdrafts exceeding the climb capability of most aircraft. Pilots should ensure they utilise their aircraft's weather radar (if equipped) and avoid sharp, contouring returns by a safe distance (generally 10nm at lower levels, up to 30nm at higher levels). See Radio Telephony for phraseology guidance. If a thunderstorm is present within 5nm of your intended approach or departure path, you should delay commencing the approach or the takeoff roll. Ensure that you communicate these requirements with ATS as soon as possible, as there are likely significant coordination and separation assurance requirements which will need to be conducted to provide you with a particular clearance. Icing Different operators and aircraft manufacturers define icing conditions differently, however a common marker is the presence of visibile moisture (rain, cloud, mist, etc) with an OAT of 5\u00b0C or below. When ice forms on an aircraft, it can add significant weight (sometimes exceeding the aircraft's MTOW ). Ice forming on the wings and other aerofoils can disrupt laminar airflow and cause a large decrease in the amount of lift produced. This effect is extended to propellers and rotor blades, which will see a significant reduction in thrust as a result. Ice generally (but not always) forms in fixed temperature bands, with icing possible between 0\u00b0C and -40\u00b0C. The most common icing bands are below: Temperature Range Ice Type Hazard 0\u00b0C to -10\u00b0C Clear Ice Large amount of added weight, aerofoil airflow disruption -10\u00b0C to -20\u00b0C Rime Ice Aerofoil airflow disruption, small amount of added weight -10\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C Mixed Ice Combination of Clear & Rime Ice Ice Protection Systems Aircraft which regularly operate in these icing bands are generally equipped with ice protection systems. Anti-ice systems prevent the formation of ice by heating or otherwise treating aircraft surfaces. De-ice systems remove ice once it has formed by heating, expanding, or otherwise treating aircraft surfaces. Pilots should be aware of the presence of forecast severe icing (through SIGMETs and SIGWX / GAF charts) and, if necessary, plan an amended route which avoids high terrain and would facilitate descent below the freezing level if severe icing is encountered. Pilots of aircraft which are not equipped with ice protection must not plan to enter visible moisture above the freezing level. Warning No aircraft is certified to operate in severe icing. Should severe icing be encountered, pilots must take action to leave the area as soon as practical. Windshear/Wake Turbulence Whilst simulators have traditionally not modelled the effects of windshear and wake turbulence on aircraft, newer generation software is starting to replicate this hazard. ATC will apply the following wake turbulence separation between successive departures, however pilots should inform ATC as soon as possible if a longer delay is preferred. Lead Aircraft Following Aircraft Time (min) Distance (nm) Super Heavy 2 6 Medium 3 7 Light 3 8 Heavy Heavy - 4 Medium 2 5 Light 2 6 Medium Light 2 5 Avoidance/Mitigation Where windshear is known or forecast, pilots should mitigate its effects during takeoff by: Using the longest runway available or choosing the most into wind runway Using a lower flap setting Using a higher takeoff power setting Rotating at the normal predetermined speed Where performance allows, sacrificing initial climb gradient for increased IAS During approach and landing, windshear can be mitigated by: Using a runway which minimises exposure to the windshear Increasing the aircraft's approach speed value Using a lower flap setting Avoiding large reductions in power until approaching the flare Mountain Waves Turbulent airflow with strong downdrafts can be present in the lee of mountain ranges when certain conditions are met. This can create a strong hazard to small aircraft, which may not be able to outclimb the sinking air. Note Mountain waves are unlikely in most simulators, however with the introduction of next generation software which replicates the movement of the air mass in a much more realistic way, the chance of encountering turbulence and downdrafts is increasing. The conditions likely to form mountain waves are: Wind of at least 15kt flowing perpendicular to the mountain range Increase in wind strength with an increase in altitude Temperature inversion above the mountain top Where possible, pilots should avoid areas of known or possible mountain wave activity. If it is necessary to cross a mountain range during these conditions, do so as high above the range as possible, and cross at a 45\u00b0 angle so that the aircraft can be quickly turned back to the windward side if required.","title":"Hazards"},{"location":"meteorology/hazards/#thunderstorms","text":"Thunderstorms pose a major risk to all aircraft, with a high likelihood of heavy precipitation, hail, strong & gusty winds, and severe turbulence.

They are also commonly flown during VMC to provide a stable, predictable flight path for the aircraft to follow. The procedures are categorised as either 2D or 3D , and can be flown as a runway aligned approach (terminating at a position from which the pilot can land on the aligned runway) or as a circling approach . Tip AIP ENR 1.5 details a number of IAP -relevant items and is suggested further reading for pilots who want to learn more about the rules which govern IFR flying in the real world. Charts Charts for procedures in the Australian FIR are published by Airservices Australia (available for free on the AIP website) or by Jeppesen (available with the Navigraph subscription). Tip VATPAC's Chart Finder tool provides free, easy access to all Airservices Australia charts. Each IAP chart features a description of the procedure (including relevant tracks and distances to be flown), navaid information, the minimum altitude to which the procedure may be flown, and the published missed approach to be followed in case a landing can't be carried out. Refer to the user guide of your chosen chart provider for details on interpreting each type of chart. Any coded procedure in an aircraft's FMS or GPS should be cross-checked with the appropriate chart prior to commencing the approach. Additionally, the chart should be reviewed to identify the relevant details which will impact if/when a pilot will conduct a missed approach, and how they will manoeuvre the aircraft to land if they become visual. Descent Below the LSALT There are a variety of situations where real pilots may descend below the LSALT , but for VATSIM purposes, the following simplification is sufficient: You must remain above the LSALT unless you are visual by day, under ATC control in controlled airspace, or conducting an instrument approach. When utilising an IAP to descend below the LSALT , you must ensure that you track via an initial approach fix. In some situations, ATC will vector you to join the approach after the IAF in controlled airspace. All ground-based navaids must be tuned and identified (using their morse code identifier or an appropriate aircraft system) prior to commencing the approach. It may be necessary to apply a correction to the published minima, depending on the source of QNH used. See Altimetry for more details. 3D Approaches 3D approaches provide both lateral and vertical guidance, and generally allow for a lower minima. The minima for 3D approaches is a 'Decision Altitude' which may reference either radio height (above the threshold elevation) or barometric altitude ( AMSL ). ILS / GLS An ILS uses radio waves to transmit a localiser (lateral tracking) and glideslope (vertical tracking) path for an aircraft to follow. A GLS provides the same functionality but uses highly accurate GNSS to do so. The ILS frequency is tuned into a VHF Nav radio, while a GLS is setup through the aircraft's FMS or GPS system. An additional radio panel component may be present in some aircraft to enter the GLS code. When ATC is providing vectors to intercept the LOC / FAC , expect to be established at least 2nm prior to the FAP. RNP (LNAV/VNAV) An RNP (LNAV/VNAV) uses specialised aircraft equipment to produce a pseudo-glideslope for the aircraft to follow during an area-navigation-based approach (generally GNSS ). 2D Approaches 2D approaches provide lateral guidance only. The vertical profile must be maintained manually by the pilot during the approach. The minima for 2D approaches is a 'Minimum Descent Altitude' which may be maintained until reaching the missed approach point. If the pilot is unable to conduct a landing at that point, a missed approach must be carried out. Most 2D approaches follow a 3\u00b0 descent profile, with distance/altitude guidance tables to help pilots determine whether they are on profile. As a general rule of thumb, a 3\u00b0 profile involves descending 320ft/1nm or 1,000ft/3nm. This makes determining whether you are on, above, or below profile easier. Example The profile height of an aircraft on a 5nm final is roughly 1,600ft . If a pilot finds themselves at 1,520ft, they can determine that they are slighly below profile. To maintain a 3\u00b0 profile descent, pilots can determine the required vertical speed by multiplying their groundspeed by 5. Example To maintain a 3\u00b0 profile descent at 160kt , a vertical speed of roughly 800fpm is required. RNP An RNP uses an aircraft's area navigation system (typically GNSS ) to track via pre-programmed waypoints along a surveyed path. They are commonly flown at aerodromes not equipped with a 3D approach. Due to the varying position of real world satellites, pilots must ensure that a sufficient number of satellites will be within view of the aircraft prior to conducting an RNP approach using GNSS . This problem is rarely seen in a simulator. You must commence an RNP approach from an IAF waypoint unless instructed by ATC in controlled airspace to join at the Intermediate Fix. Each waypoint on an approach is named using a pre-defined format. The first 3 characters describe the location (and may include a version number), the 4th character describes the direction from the aerodrome, and the last character describes the waypoint type. Example The Final Fix on the YSDU RNP RWY 05 is named DBOWF . DBO describes the aerodrome (Dubbo) W describes the direction (west of the aerodrome) F describes the waypoint type (Final Fix) The Initial Approach Fixes on the YMOR RNP RWY 19 are named OR2NA , OR2NB , and OR2NC . OR2 describes the aerodrome (Moree) and the version number of the procedure design (2) N describes the direction (north of the aerodrome) A/B/C describes the waypoint type (Initial Approach Fix) LOC A Localiser approach uses the lateral tracking guidance of the localiser beam without reference to the glideslope. They are generally flown when an ILS is partially unserviceable or where local terrain does not allow for a glideslope to be installed. VOR A VOR approach uses a defined VOR radial which is established as the inbound approach course. VOR approaches may be joined from a variety of positions (as dictated by the chart), generally from: A position on the inbound radial Overhead the aid (involving an outbound radial and either a procedure turn or pilot-driven turn to intercept the inbound radial) A position on a DME arc (involving flying along the arc until reaching the inbound radial) NDB An NDB approach uses the deflection of the ADF needle to track along a defined radial/bearing. Like VOR approaches, NDB approaches may be joined from a variety of positions. A position on the inbound radial Overhead the aid (involving an outbound radial and either a procedure turn or pilot-driven turn to intercept the inbound radial) A position on a DME arc (involving flying along the arc until reaching the inbound radial) DME / GNSS Arrivals (DGAs) Whereas instrument approaches generally prescribe specific tracks to be flown, DGAs provide a variety of sectors for an aircraft to track via, allowing pilots to remain above the relevant MSA as they track towards a VOR or NDB . DGAs terminate in the circling area, requiring a circling approach unless the aircraft is able to complete a straight-in landing. These arrivals give pilots flexibility to safely descend below the LSALT without having to manoeuvre to join an instrument approach, which saves time and fuel. Where manoeuvring is required during the arrival, it must be completed prior to the FAF. From the FAF, the aircraft must track direct to the navaid. Circling Approaches Pilots must select the minima to which they will conduct an instrument approach. They have the option of completing an approach to the straight-in minima (and then conducting a straight-in landing) or to the circling minima (and manoeuvring within the circling area). Aerodromes with circling approaches have surveyed circling areas . Pilots will generally maintain the circling minima while they manoeuvre the aircraft inside the circling area to join the circuit. Once they are at a suitable point, they will commence descent in accordance with a normal circuit. Some charts dictate 'No Circling Areas', where the normal circling height might not be sufficient to avoid terrain or obstacles. These areas may be entered by day only. Circling Areas Circling areas are surveyed regions calculated by connecting arcs of a given radius from each usable runway threshold. The circling area size is dependent on the aircraft category . Category Circling Area Radius A 1.68nm B 2.66nm C 4.20nm D 5.28nm E 6.94nm Missed Approaches For VATSIM purposes, a missed approach must be conducted any time an aircraft is: Not visual at the minima Loses visual reference with the runway environment in the circling area Unstable during the final segment of the approach Unable to complete the approach (due to navaid or aircraft system failure) Unless visual by day, if a go around or missed approach is required, an aircraft conducting an instrument approach must conduct the published missed approach (as per the chart). Note A clearance to conduct an instrument approach in CTA constitutes a clearance to conduct the published missed approach. No additional clearance is required (including to re-enter CTA where the instrument approach procedure tracks the aircraft to leave CTA vertically or laterally). An explicit airways clearance is required if an instrument approach is commenced from OCTA and the published missed approach (or any other missed approach intentions) involve entering CTA . Where a failure of the navaid or aircraft system renders the approach impossible to continue, the published missed approach should be carried out to the best of the pilot's ability (including dead reckoning where necessary).","title":"Instrument Approaches"},{"location":"navigation/iaps/#background","text":"Instrument approaches provide a charted, surveyed path for aircraft to safely descend below the LSALT in adverse weather conditions or at night.

Standard Instrument Departures (SIDs) A SID is a charted procedure which directs the aircraft along a surveyed path. They ensure terrain & obstacle clearance and will often have some form of traffic or airspace separation built in, particularly when used around busy, controlled aerodromes. SIDs are generally defined for controlled aerodromes, providing terrain & obstacle clearance, segregated traffic corridors, and airspace containment. They are also available at some uncontrolled aerodromes, providing terrain & obstacle clearance and sometimes providing a path clear of surrounding SUA. Height and speed restrictions may be present on different procedures to ensure that aircraft remain within the surveyed track. These must be complied with in CTA unless ATS explicitly cancels them. Transitions At some locations, a single SID procedure can terminate at various positions. In these situations, each terminating waypoint is defined as a transition . When ATS issue an airways clearance which includes the use of the SID , the applicable transition will be specified. It is important that the correct transition is selected in your aircraft's FMS/GPS. Procedures which terminate at a single waypoint do not specify a transition. Procedural SIDs Procedural SIDs instruct pilots to track to a variety of waypoints, intersections, and other positions, with little input from ATS . In Australia, procedural SIDs generally require an area navigation system and are labelled as RNAV SIDs. Procedural SID Title Note Some procedural SIDs have radar transitions, from which pilots will receive vectors or other tracking instructions from ATS . These should not be confused with Radar SIDs . Radar SIDs Radar SIDs provide initial tracking instructions until a given altitude or position, then instruct pilots to comply with their assigned departure instructions. In Australia, radar SIDs are labelled with the RADAR qualifier. Radar SID Title Departure instructions may take the form of an assigned heading (which should be flown uncorrected for wind) or an assigned track (which should be flown corrected for wind). Important Pilots must not commence their takeoff roll when assigned a radar SID unless they have received their departure instructions. Phraseology SY ADC : \"RXA6166, assigned heading left 230, runway 34L, cleared for takeoff\" RXA6166 : \"Assigned heading left 230, runway 34L, cleared for takeoff, RXA6166\" Visual Departures When visual by day, pilots may elect (or be instructed) to depart visually. In this case, no SID will be issued with an airways clearance. Instead, the pilot will be instructed to make a left or right turn with their takeoff clearance. Phraseology CFS ADC : \"QLK106D, runway 21, cleared for takeoff, make left turn\" QLK106D : \"Runway 21, cleared for takeoff, make left turn, QLK106D\" Pilots should climb to a safe altitude (generally 500ft AGL ), then commence a turn as instructed by ATS and intercept their outbound track. When operating OCTA , pilots should generally depart via a leg of the standard circuit. Other Departure Methods During times where a visual departure is not suitable but no SIDs are published for a particular aerodrome, pilots must depart in an appropriate way to ensure terrain & obstacle clearance. Published Company Procedures Whilst hard to come by on VATSIM, in the real world, some operators publish climb procedures to be used by crew when departing at night or in bad weather. In CTA , a clearance must be obtained to track via these procedures. Tip As ATS do not have access to these company procedures, ensure that you describe how you wish to track in detail, to give controllers a good understanding of your intentions and issue a clearance as such. Climb in the Circling Area The circling area is a surveyed area surrounding each usable runway which provides pilots with terrain & obstacle clearance below the MSA . Pilots may elect to circle inside the circling area on climb to the MSA , then depart on track where a visual departure is not suitable. Engine Out Procedures Specific engine out departure procedures are available for most runways and used in the real world to ensure terrain & obstacle clearance in the event of an engine failure during the takeoff or departure phase.

If you notice you\u2019re off track, take immediate action to correct it and notify ATC. Generally speaking, you should use the most precise navigation system available to you. The order of precision is as follows: Localiser GNSS VOR NDB Area Navigation The vast majority of navigation is performed using an area navigation system like GNSS . This should be supplemented with ground-based aids and your position should be cross-checked as often as practical. Additionally, after passing each waypoint, you should cross-check the programmed track and distance to the next waypoint against your flight plan, to ensure that the aircraft is navigating along the predicted path. Position Fixing A positive fix is a confirmed position of your aircraft. You can get a positive fix by: Station passage of a navigation aid like an NDB , VOR , or DME Intersecting two or more position lines (like radials from VORs) that cross at a sufficiently large angle (at least 45\u00b0) Using an area navigation system, like GNSS IFR aircraft are required to obtain a positive fix at least every two hours , unless navigating by reference to an area navigation system. Station Passage Station passage occurs when your aircraft flies directly overhead a navigation aid like a VOR , NDB , or DME . This indicates you've passed the aid and need to switch to the next leg of your route. Some aids will produce a 'cone of confusion' directly overhead, which creates a small area where no signal is received. This will likely result in your CDI flagging and any readings disappearing. Station passage is indicated differently for different navaids: Navaid Indication VOR TO-FROM flag changing, cone of confusion NDB Bearing needle swinging rapidly to indicate the station's position as being behind you DME Distance reading reducing to slightly above zero (a number representing your altitude in nautical miles), then increasing Navaid Ranges VOR Unless otherwise notified, each VOR has the same approximate range, dependent on aircraft altitude above the station. Aircraft Altitude (ft) Approximate Range (nm) 1,000 40 5,000 85 10,000 120 20,000 175 NDB Each NDB transmits at a different power, resulting in a different range. Due to the way the signal propagates, some stations may have different ranges during the day and night, or in different directions. Each station's range is listed in the ERSA entry for the airport. LSALT The LSALT is the lowest altitude which ensures you are safely above any terrain or obstacles along your route. You must always plan to remain above the LSALT , unless visual by day, using a NVIS , in the process of arriving or departing an aerodrome, or being radar vectored by ATC. Various types of LSALT exist: Type Explanation Route LSALT Calculated from the enroute or terminal area charts for a published airway Grid LSALT A grid square on an ERC or TAC , covers a wider area than a Route LSALT Aerodrome MSA Published for aerodromes with instrument approach procedures, depicted on DAP charts and providing a high resolution, sector-based LSALT Pilot Calculated LSALT A custom level calculated by the pilot by considering the highest terrain & obstacle levels along a desired track, with allowances for the navigational tolerances of the navaid in use Note Published Route LSALTs assume a navigational tolerance of RNP2. Pilot Calculated LSALT Pilot Calculated LSALTs are primarily used to allow smaller aircraft to fly lower, often avoiding icing conditions. Calculating them is complicated and covered by the AIP . When referring to an altitude which uses a pilot calculated LSALT , the phrase 'pilot calculated' should be appended to the level. Example DFR : \"DFR, climbing to A048 pilot calculated\" BLA : \"DFR, no reported IFR traffic\" Visual Below the LSALT When visual by day, you may maintain visual separation with the terrain and any obstacles, and descend below the LSALT . If ATC instructs you to descend below the applicable LSALT in CTA in this manner, they will append the phrase 'visual' to any level instruction. This must be read back in the same manner. Important You must not accept a visual level unless you have reported visual to ATC and are assured that you can maintain ongoing visual reference to the ground or water. Example SAS : \"FD203, descend to A015 visual\" FD203 : \"Descend to A015 visual, FD203\" NVIS Operations Pilots may descend below the LSALT when clear of cloud by night, provided they are using NVIS .

Equipment like GPSes and ground-based navaids can be used to supplement visual navigation. A visual fix (positively identifying your position) must be obtained every 30 minutes . Pilots may plan via any waypoint (including RNAV waypoints), track via instrument approaches, and conduct SIDs and STARs, provided they remain in VMC and comply with the rules of VFR flight. Creating a Navlog After finalising your route , a navlog should be created listing: each tracking point distance and track between each point altitude you wish to fly each leg at estimated groundspeed for each leg based on the forecast wind estimated time each leg will take Sample VFR Navlog Note In the sample navlog above, the wind and heading fields have not yet been filled out. It is best practice to obtain a forecast wind for the intended flight and calculate the heading required to maintain a given track made good, corrected for wind. These should be filled out in the appropriate fields. Wind Correction VFR navigation is built on the principle of flying a particular heading for a given amount of time, and arriving over the expected next position. The desired track to be flown must be corrected for wind to ensure that the aircraft does not drift off course. Additionally, strong headwinds or tailwinds will alter the time taken to fly each leg, and therefore the fuel required. Wind correction can be performed using a manual flight computer or a variety of online tools. Tip Search online for 'wind calculator' to access resources which will assist in determing the required wind correction. Fuel Planning Once your desired route has been chosen and your planned TAS has been corrected for wind, you can determine the total time required to complete each leg. This information can be used to determine the amount of fuel required to complete the flight. See flight planning for detailed notes on how to create an accurate fuel plan. Map Reading All maps and charts are available for free on the Airservices Australia website. Pilots should use a combination of VTCs (in terminal areas), VNCs (in surrounding areas) and WACs (outside of VNC coverage) to plot their desired track and navigate enroute. Alternatively, real world EFB apps or flight simulation products like Little Navmap and Navigraph can be used to provide moving map functions to simulated flights. During your route planning , you should select large, obvious landmarks as your tracking points. As you approach each tracking point, look for lead-in features which will aid in early recognition of each landmark. Map-to-Ground Technique As you pass overhead each tracking point, note the time on your navlog and calculate your ETA for your next point (based on your calculated leg time). Turn to your calculated heading (to correct for any wind and make good the desired track) and as you get close to the next tracking point, start looking for any identified lead-in features. You should navigate with primary reference to your map or chart, searching for large, easily identifiable features on the ground by looking in the direction where you expect to the find them. Navigate from 'map-to-ground' rather than by looking outside, finding a large feature, and trying to find it on the map. Your current position can be determined by measuring the direction from your aircraft to various identifiable landmarks and triangulating their intersection on the map. Using this method, you can calculate whether you are off track (due to actual winds differing from those forecast, or through aircraft manipulation/navigation errors), and make corrections as required. The same method can be used to determine whether your calculated leg times are accurate and apply corrections to future legs, estimating whether your current fuel state is sufficient to complete the flight. Lost Procedure If you find yourself unfamiliar with your surroundings and are no longer confident in your position, a lost procedure should be adopted. Unlike during normal navigation, scan your surroundings and read from 'ground-to-map', locating each landmark on the map after identifying it outside. By measuring the direction from your aircraft to each landmark, you can triangulate your position on the map. ATS can use their surveillance equipment (within surveillance coverage) to provide you with position information. If you become lost, request assistance from the most appropriate controller, who will attempt to identify you and provide you with tracking assistance.

General Radio Tips The key to a successful flight is often the smaller details, one of which being efficient, timely use of the radio. Pilots should strive to keep their radio calls as clear, concise, and standardised as possible. At any one time, there may be over a dozen aircraft on frequency. If every pilot takes an extra 5 seconds to pass their message, that's an entire minute lost for the controller! Keep things short, clear, and by the book. Before Transmitting It is important that you don't interrupt an ongoing conversation on frequency, which may require a station to transmit their message again, wasting time and preventing others from passing their own messages. When switching to a new frequency, you should wait 3-5 seconds to ensure that another interaction is not taking place, then pass your message. Transmission of Numbers Callsigns Numbers should be grouped in pairs, from right to left.

Format \" ATC Unit , Callsign , Parking Position , request engine start\" Pushback Format \" Callsign , Parking Position , request pushback\" Standby for Ground Procedures At certain major aerodromes, SMC frequency congestion is managed by requiring pilots to request pushback or taxi on a dedicated frequency. This is generally ACD or, at Sydney, Coordinator. Pilots will be notified of these procedures by the inclusion of WHEN READY FOR PUSHBACK OR TAXI, CONTACT [STATION] ON [FREQUENCY] on the ATIS . Pilots of aircraft requiring pushback must contact the applicable station when ready to commence push. Pilots of aircraft not requiring pushback must contact the station when ready to taxi. Pending controller workload and aerodrome congestion, the pilot will either be instructed to remain on the Coordinator/ ACD frequency (and informed of any expected delay) or told to 'standby for ground' . Pilots must read this instruction back, then switch to the applicable SMC frequency and monitor the frequency. Pilots must not contact the controller directly, the controller will initiate contact with the pilot when they are able to. Example VOZ851 : \"Sydney Coordinator, VOZ851, bay 33, request pushback\" SY COORD : \"VOZ851, standby for ground, 121.7\" VOZ851 : \"Standby for ground, 121.7, VOZ851\" VOZ851 switches to 121.7 and waits for the controller to contact them . SY SMC : \"VOZ851, pushback approved\" VOZ851 : \"Pushback approved, VOZ851\" Taxi Fixed Wing Format \" Callsign , ATIS Code , request taxi, [ Desired Holding Point ] \" In response, ATC will provide taxi instructions to the runway or to an intermediate point if required. Where unrestricted taxi to the runway (or your parking bay) is not immediately available, you may receive instructions to hold short of a position or give way to other aircraft. Example JST512 : \"JST512, received F, request taxi, holding point B4 or better\" SY SMC : \"JST512, taxi via B4, hold short of B\" JST512 : \"Taxi via B4, hold short of B, JST512\" SY SMC : \"JST512, give way to the Qantas 737 northbound on B, taxi to holding point B4, runway 16R\" JST512 : \"Give way to the Qantas 737, taxi to holding point B4, runway 16R, JST512\" Aircraft which do not require pushback should follow Standby for Ground Procedures when ready for taxi, if the procedures are nominated on the ATIS . Helicopters Helicopters can either ground taxi, air taxi, or air transit around an aerodrome. Taxi Technique Meaning Ground Taxi Traditional taxi using an aerodrome's taxiways, by helicopters equipped with wheels Air Taxi Transit of a helicopter in ground effect and at less than 20kt Air Transit Expeditious transit of a helicopter at or below 100ft AGL and at speeds greater than those during air taxiing Helicopter pilots should generally nominate which method they would like to use, however air transits may not always be available. Example HSZ : \"Bankstown Ground, helicopter HSZ, taxiway F, for the main pad, received V, request air taxi\" BK SMC : \"HSZ, air taxi to the main pad\" HSZ : \"Air taxi to the main pad, HSZ\" Takeoff & Landing Reporting Ready After receiving unrestricted taxi instructions to the holding point and after completing all necessary pre-takeoff checks, report 'ready' to ADC . Format \" ATC Unit , Callsign , ready\" Important In Australia, only international aircraft will be explicitly transferred from SMC to ADC (and vice versa). Domestic aircraft should switch to the ADC frequency without direction from SMC when approaching the instructed holding point and when ready for departure. Takeoff Clearance ATC may provide departure instructions with a takeoff clearance, including an assigned heading or a turn instruction. Example \"RXA6166, assigned heading left 230, runway 34L, cleared for takeoff\" Important You must obtain departure instructions prior to commencing your takeoff roll if you have been cleared via a radar SID . If ATC fails to provide relevant instructions, it is your responsibility to query them. Landing Clearance ATC may provide runway vacating instructions, wind information, and/or other relevant information with a landing clearance. Example SY ADC : \"QLK52D, the crossing runway is available to vacate, wind 180 degrees at 18kt, runway 16R, cleared to land\" QLK52D : \"16R, cleared to land, QLK52D\" Outside the Manoeuvring Area Helicopters and some light aircraft may operate from areas outside the manoeuvring area, such as hospital helipads or small airstrips inside the CTR , or other locations on the aerodrome. A takeoff/landing clearance will not be provided in these situations but approval must be sought to become airborne inside the control zone. After obtaining an airways clearance, ATC will instruct you to 'report airborne' or 'report on the ground' . Example RSCU201 is a VFR helicopter at St George Hospital (inside the Sydney CTR ) RSCU201 : \"Sydney Tower, helicopter RSCU201, St George Hospital, for YSBK, received F, ready\" SY ADC : \"RSCU201, cleared to YSBK direct, climb to A015 visual, squawk 0466, report airborne\" RSCU201 : \"Cleared to YSBK direct, climb to A015 visual, squawk 0466, RSCU201\" RSCU201 : \"RSCU201, airborne\" Example YOE is a VFR helicopter inbound on the Maroubra inbound helicopter route to YSSY YOE : \"Sydney Tower, helicopter YOE\" SY ADC : \"YOE, Sydney Tower, cleared visual approach to H8, report on the ground\" YOE : \"Cleared visual approach to H8, YOE\" YOE : \"YOE on the pad\" Circuits Takeoff Clearance Unless it is implied by runway configuration or ERSA/ Local Procedure , circuit direction will be nominated with takeoff clearance.
