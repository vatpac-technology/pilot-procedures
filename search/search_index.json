When holding at an unpublished hold (where no details are published for that waypoint), ATC will specify these details.</p> <p>There are a variety of procedures specific to holds, which are covered on the Holding page.</p> <p>In the real world, it is common practice for pilots to be issued an onwards clearance which includes a nominated hold exit time. Pilots are responsible for ensuring they adjust their speed and the length of the pattern (with ATC approval) to pass over the holding fix at the specified time. This practice is rare online but sometimes offered to experienced pilots. Pilots in receipt of a hold exit time must cross the holding fix at up to 0 seconds late and 60 seconds early.</p> <p>Some airliner avionics will allow pilots to adjust the required time of departure from the fix, with the aircraft autothrottle adjusting the speed to meet the time.

Pilots in receipt of a waypoint crossing time must cross the fix at up to 0 seconds late and 30 seconds early.</p> <p>Complying with a crossing time is simple. Most airliners have the ability to provide a Required Time of Arrival, either through a dedicated RTA page or by editing the waypoint details on the flight plan page. </p> <p>Pilots of aircraft without these systems should adjust their speed (generally involving a speed reduction) until their FMS/GPS indicates the required ETA for the relevant waypoint.

To comply with the time, the pilot should reduce speed (to not below minimum speed) until the FMS ETA for WELSH changes to 43.</p> <p>Given that the accepted window for the crossing time is 0 seconds late and up to 30 seconds early, the pilot should then increase speed slightly so that the FMS indicates an ETA of 42.

Using a VTC, VNC, or WAC (available on the Airservices Australia website), plot your departure and destination airports, then assess any route requirements to remain clear of obstacles, CTA, or PRDs. From there, select a route which will provide easy visual navigation, with frequent landmarks (such as mountain peaks, lakes, river junctions, towns, racetracks, etc) on and either side of your planned track.

This provides pilots with terrain/obstacle clearance assurance and helps manage traffic in busy terminal areas by defining a designated inbound and outbound track. Some airways are designated as one-way tracks, while others allow traffic to utilise it in both directions.</p> <p>Pilots should use an ERC in conjunction with a TAC around major aerodromes to determine the best route. For operations at or below FL200, use the ERC-L (low). Operations above FL200 should use the ERC-H (high). Some remote aerodromes aren't serviced by airways, so it may be desirable to plan direct to an appropriate fix instead.</p> <p>When planning a route, consider any airspace requirements (particularly when operating to, from, or in the vicinity of major aerodromes) and ensure you comply with the ERSA Flight Planning Requirements as detailed below. Also consider the terrain you'll be flying over. During the winter months, icing can become a serious threat to aircraft without ice protection equipment and an alternate route may need to be planned to avoid areas of high terrain, allowing the aircraft to operate in the warmer air at lower altitudes. Each degree of latitude/longitude on an ERC-L is divided into a grid, and a Grid LSALT is published for each square denoting the lowest safe altitude for operations in that area.
