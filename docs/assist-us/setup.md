We'll kick off by setting up your local development environment. 

!!! important
    If you have any questions about setting up your development environment for these SOPs, or you get stuck - feel free to reach out to the Operations Team.

## Requirements

To contribute, you'll need the following -

  * A basic code editor or IDE. 
    * We recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){target=blank} with a Markdown helper plugin.
  * A GitHub account, and a local Git environment - [GitHub Quickstart Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart){target=blank}.
  * Python - [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/){target=blank}
  * git - [Download git](https://git-scm.com/){target=blank}

## Lets get cracking!

- Fork and clone the [**Pilot Procedures Project**](https://github.com/vatpac-technology/pilot-procedures){target=new} - [Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo){target=new}.
- Install the following Python packages: `mkdocs-material, mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin, mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin` and `mkdocs-redirects`.

!!! info "Easy Python Package Installation"
    These packages can be installed easily through a single command.

    ``` python
      pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    !!! error ""
        You'll still need to ensure you have Python installed first, as these use **pip** - a Python package installer.

- Once you've installed the requirements, open a command line terminal, `cd` into the cloned repository and start the mkdocs service:

```
mkdocs serve
```
OR
```
python -m mkdocs serve
```

- You'll see the command line performing some magic, eventually displaying `Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Open up your web browser, and navigate to that address.

## Common Setup Issues
### 'pip' Term not Recognised
When running the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command, you may receive an error preventing any packages from being installed. Check that Python is installed and accessible by typing `python` into a VS Code terminal. If necessary, the Windows Store will open and allow you to install the correct Python package. Restart VS Code before continuing.

### Script installed 'Not on PATH'
After running the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command, some packages may produce yellow warnings, such as below:

!!! example ""
    *"WARNING: The script watchmedo.exe is installed in 'C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.10_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python310\Scripts' which is not on PATH. Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location."*

Python is recognised but some scripts have been installed beyond the scope of the software.  Update your Windows *PATH* variable to include the path indicated in the error.  

Follow the steps [here](https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-add-python-to-path-variable-in-windows){target=new} to update your Windows PATH variable. Restart VS Code before continuing.

### Bad git Executable
When running `mkdocs serve` without first installing git, the following error may be received:

!!! example ""
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.13_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python313\site-packages\git\__init__.py", line 296, in <module\> refresh()  
        ~~~~~~~^^  
    File "C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.13_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python313\site-packages\git\__init__.py", line 287, in refresh  
        if not Git.refresh(path=path):  
            ~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^  
    File "C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.13_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python313\site-packages\git\cmd.py", line 860, in refresh  
        raise ImportError(err)  
    ImportError: Bad git executable.  
    The git executable must be specified in one of the following ways:  
        - be included in your $PATH  
        - be set via $GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE  
        - explicitly set via git.refresh(<full-path-to-git-executable\>)  
    All git commands will error until this is rectified.

Install [git](https://git-scm.com/){target=blank} to rectify the error.
