--8<-- "includes/abbreviations.md"

## Navigation Requirements
- Requirement for visual fix every 30 minutes
- Allowed to use GPS and navaids, but only to supplement visual navigation
- Allowed to plan via RNAV waypoints, fly instrument approaches, etc, provided you remain in VMC and comply with VFR

## Creating a Navlog
- After finalising route, writing each point down
- Simplfied wind correction (using slide rule or online calculator)
- Calculating enroute time and fuel requirements (link to Flight Planning section)

## Map Reading
- Use of VTCs in terminal areas, VNCs in surrounding areas, and WACs where necessary
- Choosing easily-identifiable features from the air with lead in features to assist in early recognition

## Map-to-Ground Technique
- Use time travelled and estimated GS to estimate distance travelled since last position fix
- Find major features on map and locate outside
- Triangulate actual position using displacement from features
- Wind adjustment where winds are different to forecast
