  title: Visual Approaches
---

--8<-- "includes/abbreviations.md"

## Background
Visual approaches are the 'default' approach performed by aircraft when they have visual reference with the ground or water. They often provide reduced track miles compared to an instrument approach and may allow ATC to relax some of the separation requirements normally required.

Where an ATIS does not specify an approach type, pilots should prepare for a visual approach and report visual to the terminal controller as soon as practical.

## Requirements
Strict requirements dictate when visual approaches may be executed. These vary based on the time of day.

### By Day
In order to conduct a visual approach by day, the following requirements apply.

- Be within 30nm of the aerodrome, not below the LSALT/MSA
- Clear of cloud
- In sight of ground or water
- Inflight visibility not less than 5,000m or the aerodrome in sight
- Remain at least 500ft above the CTA lower limit unless in receipt of a clearance to leave CTA on descent (if in CTA)
- Remain above the [minimum height](../airspace/rulesofflight.md#altitude-requirements) above populated and unpopulated areas

### By Night
In order to conduct a visual approach by night, the following requirements apply.

- Clear of cloud
- In sight of ground or water
- Inflight visibility not less than 5,000m
- Remain at least 500ft above the CTA lower limit unless in receipt of a clearance to leave CTA on descent (if in CTA)
- Remain above the LSALT/MSA, DGA step altitude, or assigned altitude if being vectored until:
    - Inside the circling area or 3nm if no defined circling area with the aerodrome in sight, or
    - Within 5nm (7nm for a runway equipped with an ILS/GLS) of the aerodrome, aligned with the runway centreline and established not below 'on-slope' on the PAPI/T-VASIS
    - Within 10nm (14nm for RWY 16L/34L at YSSY) of the aerodrome, established not below the glide path with less than full scale localiser deflection

## Expectations in CTA
In CTA, ATC will sometimes provide instructions on how to join the circuit from a visual approach.

When tracking via a STAR, you must continue to track laterally via the STAR.

!!! phraseology
    *"VOZ882, cleared visual approach via the STAR."*

If ATC instruct you to **join** a particular leg of the circuit, you should remain on track until approaching the circuit area, then join the assigned circuit leg.

!!! phraseology
    *"CYF, join left downwind runway 25, cleared visual approach."*

If ATC instruct you to **track for** a particular leg of the circuit, you should immediately track to that leg of the circuit.

!!! phraseology
    *"AM231, track for base runway 32, cleared visual approach."*

### Go Arounds
If an aircraft is required to go around from a visual approach, they should:

- Maintain runway track (unless obstacles prohibit climb straight ahead, in which case a turn may be made)
- Commence climb
- Await further instructions from ATC

Aircraft which have been cleared for an [instrument approach](./iaps.md), have become visual, and then are required to go around, must track via the published missed approach on the instrument approach chart.

At some locations, [local procedures](../../local-procedures/) dictate pre-defined missed approach procedures for visual approaches.

!!! example
    At [YSSY](../local-procedures/Class%20C/sydney.md#missed-approach), aircraft cleared via an Independent Visual Approach who are required to go around must track via the published missed approach of the ILS or GLS approach to their assigned runway.
