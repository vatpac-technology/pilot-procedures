Pilot Procedures is designed to provide virtual pilots with all the information they need to plan and conduct a flight in VATPAC airspace. Each section focuses on a particular avenue of foundational knowledge, summarising various real world policy & procedure documents such as the AIP, VFRG, and ERSA. [Local Procedures](../local-procedures/) provides detailed procedures specific to particular aerodromes and terminal areas, which allow pilots to operate seemlessly with VATPAC controllers.

!!! note
    Whilst the site is based on real world information, some of the content has been simplified or generalised to cater for our virtual pilot audience.

### New to **VATSIM**?
The best way to get started with VATSIM is to visit the [VATSIM website](https://vatsim.net/){target=new} and create an account. Pilots should then head to our [VATSIM Operations](../airspace/vatsimoperations.md) page to learn about some of the key differences between flying in the real world and flying online. Don't worry, a pilot licence isn't a prerequisite to flying on VATSIM, much of the knowledge you'll need is contained right here.

The VATSIM [Code of Conduct](../airspace/vatsimoperations.md#vatsim-code-of-conduct) requires pilots to demonstrate general competency on their aircraft before connecting to the network, so make sure you know the basics (how to comply with heading, altitude, speed, and holding instructions) and how to operate the aircraft in a controlled manner.

!!! tip
    We strongly recommend flying a new aircraft **offline** before bringing it onto the network. Practice some of the instructions you may receive from a controller, including turning onto a particular heading, climbing and descending to a non-standard altitude, programming and flying a holding pattern, and conducting an instrument approach (if operating IFR).

As you go, it's a good idea to refer to Pilot Procedures to further your knowledge and ensure you understand a controller's expectations of you when operating under their control. Read on to learn more!

### Curious about **Flight Planning**?
In both the real world and online, the key to a successful flight is thorough, effective flight planning. Pilots of both IFR and VFR flights should ensure they spend adequate time planning their intended [flight path](../flight-planning/routeselection.md), determining the amount of [fuel required](../flight-planning/fuelplanning.md), and catering for any [adverse weather](../flight-planning/alternaterequirements.md). Whilst a number of tools exist to help with these tasks, it is still up to the pilot to cross check their output (remember: *garbage in, garbage out*), so ensure you are satisfied with what sites like SimBrief generate for you.

Once you know where you want to fly and how you want to get there, it's time to [submit a flight plan](../flight-planning/flightplansubmission.md). This is where most new pilots go wrong, choosing the wrong callsign, filing the wrong equipment codes, or letting flight planning software lead them astray with invalid routes or altitudes.

We've got notes to help even the newest pilots, so head to the [Flight Planning](../flight-planning/) section to learn more.

### Want to try **VFR**?
Generally speaking, real world pilots learn to fly VFR and then progress onto IFR after they've solidified the basics. Low time virtual pilots will benefit from following this pathway, especially at quiet aerodromes outside of controlled airspace.

VFR flights remaining OCTA do not require a [flight plan](../flight-planning/flightplansubmission.md) but pilots intending on entering or operating in close proximity to CTA are encouraged to submit one. Ensure you [contact ATS](../radio-telephony/Controlled%20Airspace/) and obtain an [airways clearance](../airspace/cta.md#airways-clearances) before entering CTA. [VFR navigation](../navigation/vfrnavigation.md) is a simple skill but incredibly rewarding when mastered, and we've got everything you need to get started.

Some of the most fun you can have in an aircraft comes from enjoying the view as you navigate over some of our country's most beautiful landscapes. Be sure to check out [Local Procedures](../local-procedures/) to learn about the specific VFR procedures each place has to offer.

### Learning more about **IFR**?
Want to fly even when the weather isn't cooperating? IFR flight allows pilots to operate in all weather conditions and at night, unlocking an entire new way to fly. Strict equipment and [planning requirements](../flight-planning/routeselection.md#ifr-route-selection) apply to IFR aircraft, and [fuel planning](../flight-planning/fuelplanning.md) becomes a little more complicated as you consider a variety of [weather phenomena](../meteorology/).

[IFR navigation](../navigation/ifrnavigation.md) involves less of looking out the window and more of relying on your instrument panel to keep you on track and at a safe altitude. When you can't see where you're going, how can you be sure that you won't hit anything? By following surveyed [instrument departures](../navigation/ifrdepartures.md), ensuring you remain above the [lowest safe altitude](../navigation/ifrnavigation.md#lsalt), and conducting a published [instrument approach](../navigation/iaps.md) when you reach your destination.

ATS are here to help as well, keeping an eye on you by providing a SARWATCH service and informing you of any hazards (including other aircraft) which might impact your flight. As a result, IFR aircraft are required to maintain two-way communications with ATS, both [outside controlled airspace](../airspace/octa.md#ifr) and while operating in [CTA](../airspace/cta.md). Our [Radio Telephony](../radio-telephony/) section has everything you need to ensure your radio calls are up to scratch for any scenario.

### Keen for More?
Pilot Procedures has documentation on [formation flying](../airspace/formation.md), scenic flights like Sydney's [Harbour Scenic](../local-procedures/Class%20C/sydney.md#harbour-scenic-flights), avoiding [windshear and wake turbulence](../meteorology/hazards.md#windshearwake-turbulence), the correct way to give a [position report](../radio-telephony/positionreports.md), and so much more.

We're just scratching the surface, so dive on in.
