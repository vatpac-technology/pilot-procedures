  title: VATSIM Operations (TODO)

## Radio Communication Differences
- Unicom instead of CTAF
- Text and voice where text pilots known to operate in the area
- Allowance for non-standard winds/weather requiring use of reciprocal runways, etc

## Top Down Rule
- Identifying who to contact
- Use of controller ATIS to determine who is providing control services for aerodrome

## Enroute Sector Extensions
- Use of controller ATIS and VATPAC website airspace map to determine sector ownership
- Being told to contact a frequency which isn't displayed in pilot client (most foreign pilots get confused by this)
