## Weather Requirements
VFR aircraft must ensure they remain in [VMC](../meteorology/vmc.md) unless operating under Special VFR or upgrading to IFR.

All aircraft must ensure that they carry enough fuel to cater for any forecast weather at their planned destination, and any enroute weather, as per [Flight Planning](../flight-planning/fuelplanning.md).

## Altitude Requirements
### Minimum Heights
Unless in the process of taking off or landing, conducting circuits or an approach, flying in a published access entry, or conducting approved low flying, you must not fly lower than the minimum altitudes specified below.

| Area | Radius | Minimum Height Above Ground or Obstacles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unpopulated | 300m | 500ft |
| Populated | Aeroplanes: 600m<br>Helicopters: 300m | 1,000ft |

!!! example
    An aeroplane flying over a township must not fly lower than 1,000ft above the highest obstacle within a 600m radius of the aircraft.

### Airspace Boundaries
The boundary between two classes of airspace takes the form of the *least* restrictive class.

!!! example
    A restricted area with a vertical definition of `SFC-A085` may be overflown **at** `A085`, as the aircraft will be deemed to be in the least restrictive class of airspace at that level.

## Right of Way
Right of way rules exist to provide a standardised response to any close-proximity scenarios.

### Converging Headings
Where two aircraft are on converging headings, the aircraft **on the right** has right of way. The other aircraft must manoeuvre as necessary to give way.

### Overtaking
Where one aircraft is overtaking another, the aircraft **being overtaken** has right of way. The other aircraft must ensure they remain clear of the slower aircraft's flight path during the overtake.

### Aircraft in Vicinity
Where multiple aircraft are operating in the vicinity of each other, they shall have right of way as described below, in descending order:

1. Balloons
2. Parachute descent
3. Unpowered glider
4. Airship
5. Aircraft which is towing something
6. Power-driven aircraft

Any aircraft on the list must give way to all other aircraft above them on the list.

!!! example
    An airship must give way to a balloon where the two are operating in close proximity of each other.

### Approach to Landing
Where two heavier-than-air aircraft are on approach to land (including operating in the circuit area), the **lower aircraft** has right of way. The higher aircraft must give way to the lower aircraft.

### Landing in Progress
Where an aircraft is in the process of landing, all other aircraft must give way to that aircraft.

### Emergency Aircraft
Where an aircraft has declared themselves to be experiencing an emergency situation, all other aircraft must give way to the emergency aircraft.

## Uncontrolled Aerodrome Separation Minima
At an uncontrolled aerodrome, pilots are responsible for ensuring that they do not get too close to other aircraft, including maintaining sufficient space during takeoff and landing.

### Takeoff
A pilot must not commence a takeoff until a preceeding departing aircraft using the same runway:

- has crossed the upwind end of the runway, or
- has commenced a turn, or
- the runway is longer than 1,800m and the other aircraft is airborne and at least 1,800m beyond the second pilot's proposed lift off point, or
- both aircraft have an MTOW below 2,000kg and the other aircraft is airborne and at least 600m beyond the second pilot's proposed lift off point

Additionally, takeoff must not commence until a landing aircraft has vacated the runway or crossed through the intersection (if using a cross runway).

### Landing
A landing aircraft must not cross the runway threshold until:

- an aircraft departing from the same runway is airborne and has commenced a turn, or
- an aircraft departing from the same runway is beyond the point on the runway where the landing aircraft expects to complete their landing roll (and sufficient spacing would exist in the event of a go around), or
- an aircraft landing on the same runway has vacated the runway or is taxiing away from the runway, or
- an aircraft landing on a cross runway has passed through, or stopped before, the runway intersection
