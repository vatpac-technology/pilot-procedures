## Taxiing
Two SMC positions exist which may sometimes be activated online. Everything west of RWY 03/21 is administered by SMC West, everything east of the runway is administered by SMC East.

## Departures
Depending on the active runway mode, the departure runway assigned to an aircraft may be dependent on the planned route.

VFR aircraft should expect to depart via a visual departure, on track to their first tracking point.

IFR aircraft should expect to be issued with a SID as per below:

| Aircraft Type | Runway | First Waypoint | SID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| All | All | OLMAM | OLMAM SID |
| All | All | OPEGA | OPEGA SID |
| All | All | SOLUS | SOLUS SID |
| Jets | All | AMANA | AMANA SID |
| Jets | All | AVNEX | AVNEX SID, or<br>EKEPO SID |
| Jets | All | HECTO | HECTO SID |
| Jets | All | MEMUP | MEMUP SID |
| Jets | All | MUBID | MUBID SID |
| Jets | All | YNRV | RAVENSTHORPE SID |
| Non-Jets | All | OTLED | OTLED SID, or<br>EKEPO SID |
| Non-Jets | All | REPOK | REPOK SID |
| Non-Jets | RWY 03 & 06 | LENVU | LENVU SID |
| Non-Jets | RWY 21 & 24 | PUMRY | PUMRY SID |

All other aircraft shall expect to be *rerouted* via the most appropriate SID terminus, or assigned the **PH (RADAR) SID**.

!!! note
    Reroutes are common for Non-Jet aircraft tracking to the east, planned via PUMRY. With RWY 03 and 06 as the duty runway, pilots can expect to be rerouted via LENVU and assigned the LENVU SID.

### Pushback/Taxi on ACD
Dring periods of peak traffic, special procedures are activated requiring pilots to contact ACD, who assesses the current aerodrome traffic levels, before they are transferred to the SMC frequency.

When the ATIS includes `ALL DEPARTURES MUST REQUEST PUSH BACK ON 118.85`, all pilots must contact ACD when ready for pushback or taxi (if no pushback is required).

!!! phraseology
    **NWK1622:** "Brisbane Delivery, NWK1622, bay 32, request pushback"  
    **PH ACD:** "NWK1622, estimated delay 10 minutes, remain this frequency."  
    **NWK1622**: "Remain this frequency, NWK1622"  

When instructed, pilots must switch to SMC and **monitor** the frequency. **Do not contact SMC**, they will call you.

!!! phraseology
    **PH ACD**: "NWK1622, standby for ground, 121.7"  
    **NWK1622**: "Standby for ground, 121.7, NWK1622"  

    *Pilot switches to 121.7 and <strong>waits for the controller to contact them</strong>.*

    **PH SMC**: "NWK1622, pushback approved"  
    **NWK1622**: "Pushback approved, NWK1622"

There may be a delay on the SMC frequency before the controller contacts you. Pilots should only initiate contact with SMC if a significant amount of time (over 10 min) has passed since the frequency transfer and no contact has been made by the controller.

## Arrivals
An ILS is available to RWY 03, RWY 21, and RWY 24. RNP and VOR approaches are available to all runways. An RNP(AR) approach is available to RWY 03.

IFR aircraft can generally expect to be processed via a STAR terminating with the following approach:

| Runway | Approach |
| --- | --- |
| 03 | ILS or RNP(AR) |
| 06 | RNP |
| 21 | ILS |
| 24 | ILS |

The RWY 21 ILS is available from both straight in and from the DME arc. Advise ATC if you are not confident flying the arc.

During periods of good weather, aircraft may be cleared via the Victor STAR for a visual approach, to reduce their track miles.

### Preferred Runway Exits
The `AIRPORT EFFICIENCY PROCEDURES` chart dictates preferred runway exits for pilots to vacate at. This ensures a predictable, efficient movement of aircraft on the aerodrome and should be abided by where possible. Where a preferred exit is not assured, pilots must inform ADC.

| Runway | Aircraft Type | Preferred Exits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RWY 03 | Non-Jet<br>F100/E195/RJ1H and below | A6, C6 |
| RWY 03 | Jet above F100/E195/RJ1H | P, D |
| RWY 21 | Non-Jet<br>Light/Medium Jet | A6, C6 |
| RWY 21 | Heavy Jet | A7, C9 |
| RWY 24 | All | J1, A |

!!! note
    At YPPH, aircraft may vacate at an earlier exit without ATC approval. Preferred exits for RWY 06 are not published due infrequent use.

### Predictable Sequencing Waypoints
ATC may utilise [predictable sequencing waypoints](../../airspace/cta.md#predictable-sequencing-waypoints) to tactically delay aircraft inbound via **Q10**, **Q32**, **Q27**, **Q41**, **Z38**, **Q9**, **Q31**, **Q38**, **Q73**, and **Q181**. Pilots should be aware of the following waypoints and expect possible tracking as per the table below.

## Scenic Flights
VFR aircraft may plan to conduct scenic flights within CTA in the PH TMA. A number of VFR routes exist to facilitate this, including:

| Name | Route | Preferred Altitude |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Victor 65 | `CTE-PCTY-HKE` | At or below `A015` |
| Victor 66 | `TLMI-HRR-CDM` | At or below `A035` |

Aircraft wishing to conduct a scenic flight over the Perth CBD should expect to be cleared via the Victor 65 route.

!!! phraseology
    **VH-CYF:** "Perth Approach, CYF, Cessna 172, overhead FREM, `A015`, received Bravo, request Victor 65"  
    **PHA:** "CYF, squawk 0542, remain clear of class C airspace"  
    **VH-CYF:** "Squawk 0542, remain OCTA, CYF"  

    *When clearance (reference traffic into/out of YPPH) is available:*  
    **PHA:** "CYF, cleared Victor 65, maintain `A015`, QNH 1012"  
    **VH-CYF:** "Cleared Victor 65, maintain `A015`, QNH 1012, CYF"

## Terminal Airspace
Unlike other TMAs, the southern portion of the Perth TMA features a large cutout, with a CTA lower level of `F125`. Aircraft departing to or arriving from the south should expect to be cleared in accordance with the change in airspace.

!!! phraseology
    **PHD**: "RXA2125, leave and re-enter controlled airspace on climb to `F180`, no reported IFR traffic"  
    **RXA2125**: "Leave and re-enter controlled airspace on climb to `F180`, RXA2125"
