## Taxiing
Where an aircraft will be taxiing via multiple taxiways of the same lettering (e.g. A6, then A5, then A4, etc), they will generally be referred to by the letter only.

!!! example
    An aircraft taxiing from the terminal to RWY 05 could be instructed to taxi "via Alpha, cross runway 30, Foxtrot, to holding point Foxtrot Six runway 05".
    
## Departures
VFR aircraft should expect to depart via a visual departure, on track to their first tracking point.

IFR aircraft should expect to be issued with a SID as per below:

| Aircraft Type | Runway | First Waypoint | SID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Jets | RWY 05 or 23 | AREPA | AREPA SID |
| Jets | RWY 05 or 23 | AVDEN | AVDEN SID |
| Jets | RWY 05 or 23 | BENDO | BENDO SID |
| Jets | RWY 05 or 23 | GILES | GILES SID |
| Jets | RWY 05 or 23 | UPROT | UPROT SID |
| Jets | RWY 05 | ORBUN | ORBUN SID |

Jet aircraft departing from RWY 05 or 23 not planned via a waypoint above can expect to be *rerouted* in accordance with the table above. All other aircraft shall expect the **AD (RADAR) SID**.

## Arrivals
An ILS is only available to RWY 23. RNP and VOR approaches are available to all runways. RNP(AR) approaches are available to RWY 05.

Jet aircraft can generally expect to be processed via a STAR. Non-jet aircraft can expect to be processed either via a STAR (terminating on an instrument approach or with vectors to the IAF) or tracking DCT AD with the expectation of joining the circuit.

Where instrument approaches are required, the following approaches are generally used:

| Runway | Approach |
| --- | --- |
| 05 | RNP(AR) or RNP if unable |
| 12 | RNP |
| 23 | ILS |
| 30 | RNP |

## VFR Operations
### Coastal Flights
VFR aircraft may plan to transit the AD CTR tracking coastal, generally not above `A005`. Pilots should file a flight plan in accordance with the route advice below:

| Direction | Route |
| --- | --- |
| North | `PNL BTJ HNL OHB` |
| South | `OHB HNL BTJ PNL` |

Expect to be issued with a clearance limit which will laterally separate you with aircraft operating at YPAD. You must not pass beyond the designated clearance limit until in receipt of an onwards clearance.

!!! phraseology
    **CEY:** "Adelaide Approach, CEY, Cessna 172, 4nm south of PNL, `A010`, received charlie, request coastal northbound"  
    **AD TCU:** "CEY, Adelaide Approach, squawk 0542, remain clear of class C airspace"  
    **CEY:** "Squawk 0542, remain OCTA, CEY"   

    **AD TCU:** "CEY, identified, cleared coastal offshore northbound, not above `A005``, clearance limit BTJ"  
    **CEY:** "Cleared coastal offshore northbound, not above `A005`, clearance limit BTJ, CEY"

In the majority of cases, AD TCU will transfer pilots to AD ADC who will manage the transit of the extended runway centreline. Where a delay is required, pilots can expect to be instructed to hold at the clearance limit.

!!! phraseology 
    **CNY:** "Adelaide Tower, CNY, maintaining not above `A005`"  
    **AD ADC:** "CNY, Adelaide Tower, hold at the clearance limit, expect onwards clearance in 5 minutes due inbound traffic"  
    **CNY:** "Hold at the clearance limit, CNY"  

When onwards clearance is available, it will be issued by ADC.

!!! phraseology 
    **AD ADC:** "CNY, cancel clearance limit, track coastal offshore northbound, not above `A005`"  
    **CNY:** "Cancel clearance limit, track coastal offshore northbound, not above `A005`, CNY"
