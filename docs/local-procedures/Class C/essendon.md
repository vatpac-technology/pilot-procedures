## Airspace
EN ADC is responsible for the Class C airspace to the southeast of YMEN from `SFC` to `A020`.

## Departures
VFR aircraft shall generally depart the zone on an extended circuit leg.

IFR aircraft shall generally expect a visual departure during VMC, otherwise the **EN (RADAR) SID**.

### Start Approval
Start approval is required for:

- Departures to YMML
- Departures to YMMB and YMAV planned above `A020`

## Arrivals
VFR departures from Class G shall be cleared (at not above `A015`) via:

| Direction | VFR Outbound Point |
|----------| ------------------------ |
| East  | DSN |
| South East  | FWO |
| South | WES |

!!! Note
    North and Westbound traffic is usally not allowed to deconflict with YMML Traffic. If possible allow them to track south and follow costal and inbound tracks.

VFR aircraft from Class G airspace should track via the following reporting points at `A015`:

| Inbound Direction | Reporting Point |
| --- | --- |
| North | KAO |
| Northeast | YYN |
| East | DSN |
| Southeast | APL |
| South | SNP |
| Southwest | WES |

IFR aircraft will generally transit the ML CTA and will likely be processed via the IAF for the most relevant instrument approach, or during VMC:

| Arrival Runway | Arrival Gate |
| --- | --- |
| 08 | 5nm Final |
| 17 | 5nm Final |
| 26 | MOSVO |
| 35 | MOSVO |

## Tower Closed Procedures
The ML Class C airspace surrounding YMEN extends to `SFC`. Airways clearances are required for all operations, however with the Tower closed, no takeoff or landing clearances will be issued. 

### Outbound
Departing aircraft must request airways clearance and engine start approval while on the bay and ML TCU will provide current weather conditions, expected runway for departure, and clearance.

!!! phraseology
    **FDK**: "Melbourne Approach, FDK, YMEN for YSHT, request clearance and engine start"  
    **ML TCU**: "FDK, Melbourne Approach, wind 290 degrees 4 knots, QNH 1017, cleared to YSHT via MNG, flight planned route, visual departure, climb to `A040`, squawk 4423, expect runway 35"  
    **FDK**: "QNH 1017, cleared to YSHT via MNG, flight planned route, visual departure, climb to `A040`, squawk 4423, FDK"  
    **ML TCU**: "FDK, start approved, report taxiing for runway 35"  
    **FDK**: "Start approved, FDK"

Report taxiing for the runway to receive traffic information.

!!! phraseology
    **FDK**: "FDK, taxiing runway 35"  
    **ML TCU**: "FDK, traffic is CBN, a Cherokee, 5nm final runway 35, report at the holding point for departure instructions"  
    **FDK**: "Copy CBN, wilco, FDK"

Expect departure instructions at the holding point.

!!! phraseology
    **FDK**: "FDK, ready runway 35"  
    **ML TCU**: "FDK, hold at the holding point, short delay due inbound aircraft"  
    **FDK**: "Hold at the holding point, FDK"  

    **ML TCU**: "FDK, make right turn, report airborne"  
    **FDK**: "Make right turn, FDK"

### Inbound
Inbound aircraft will be cleared for the relevant instrument/visual approach and instructed to report clear of the runway. It is important that you report as soon as you vacate the runway, as ML TCU will be segregating other aircraft from your possible missed approach path. Any delay may result in delays for other pilots.

!!! phraseology
    **ML TCU:** "SH490, cleared ILS Runway 26 approach, traffic taxiing for the holding point is UJA, an Aero Commander, report clear of the runway"  
    **SH490:** "Cleared ILS Runway 26, copy UJA, SH490"  

    **SH490:** "SH490, clear of the runway, Essendon, cancel SARWATCH"  
    **ML TCU:** "SH490, Essendon SARWATCH terminated"

As the aerdrome surface is uncontrolled with the Tower closed, you may taxi to your desired parking position without instruction from ML TCU.

## Sunbury Corridor
A VFR route exists to allow helicopters to transit from YMEN to the northwest under day VMC. Pilots should track in accordance with the table below:

| Direction | Tracking Points |
| --- | --- |
| Northwest | `YMML PWLC SWT` |
| Southeast | `SWT PWLC YMML` |

!!! note
    Pilots must track over the intersection of RWY 16 & RWY 27 at YMML.

Clearances are required for transit. Expect to receive a requirement to sight and maintain own separation with aircraft operating at YMML.

## Melbourne City Orbits
Visual orbits of the CBD in the overlying Class C airspace are available on request. The airspace over the CBD is managed by **Essendon ADC**, or **Melbourne TCU** when the Tower is closed.

Pilots can expect a clearance at `A015` by day or `A022` by night.

!!! phraseology
    **VCY**: "Essendon Tower, VCY, Cessna 152, 2nm south of WMS, `A015`, received Lima, request one left-hand city orbit"  
    **EN ADC**: "VCY, Essendon Tower, cleared one left-hand orbit, maintain `A015`, report clear of the zone" 
    **VCY**: "Cleared one left-hand orbit, maintain `A015`, VCY"  

    *Once clear of the Class C CTR*  
    **VCY**: "VCY, clear of the zone"  
    **EN ADC**: "VCY, identification and control services terminated, squawk 1200, frequency change approved"  
    **VCY**: "Squawk 1200, frequency change approved, VCY"
