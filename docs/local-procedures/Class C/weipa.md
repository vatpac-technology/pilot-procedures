## Airspace
YBWP is an **uncontrolled aerodrome** which sits inside the Scherger Class C control zone. When **SG TCU** is online (or **ISA** is extending top down), clearances are required for all aircraft operations.

!!! note
    While SG TCU is responsible for the airspace above YBWP, they have no jurisdiction over the runways, taxiways, or apron areas on the aerodrome itself.

### TCU Closed Procedures
When SG TCU is offline, the Class C airspace in R605A/B from `SFC` to `F125` is reclassified as Class G, and from `F125` to `F245` reclassified as Class E. YBWP reverts to CTAF procedures.

## Departures
Outbound aircraft shall report when taxiing for departure to SG TCU. Controllers will issue the aircraft with a squawk code and a traffic statement regarding any aircraft operating on, or shortly to land at, the aerodrome.

!!! note
    Both VFR and IFR aircraft require a clearance to operate in Class C airspace. The examples below show an IFR aircraft departing.

!!! phraseology
    **QLK479D**: "Scherger Approach, QLK479D, Dash 8, IFR, taxiing YBWP for YBCS, runway 12"  
    **SG TCU**: "QLK479D, squawk 4432, no reported traffic, report lined up for airways clearance"  
    **QLK479D**: "Squawk 4432, wilco, QLK479D"

In response to your ready call, SG TCU will issue an airways clearance, if available.

!!! phraseology
    **QLK479D**: "QLK479D, lined up"  
    **SG TCU**: "QLK479D, cleared to YBCS via GUPDA, flight plan route, climb to F230, make right turn, report airborne"  
    **QLK479D**: "Cleared to YBCS via GUPDA, flight plan route, climb to F230, make right turn, QLK479D"

All surface areas at YBWP are outside TCU's jurisdiction. Takeoff clearances are not given.

Once airborne, make a Class C [airborne report](../../radio-telephony/Controlled%20Airspace/terminal.md#first-contact) to SG TCU.

## Arrivals
Inbound aircraft shall request airways clearance from SG TCU (if already in ENR CTA). Aircraft may be cleared for a visual approach or one of Weipa's instrument approaches.

As a landing clearance is not given, aircraft will instead be informed of any traffic operating on the aerodrome and instructed to *'report clear of the runway'*, when their SARWATCH (for IFR aircraft) will be terminated.

!!! phraseology
    **FD491**: "FD491, visual"  
    **SG TCU**: "FD491, cleared visual approach, no reported traffic, report clear of the runway"  
    **FD491**: "Cleared visual approach, FD491"

    **FD491**: "FD491, clear of the runway, YBWP, cancel SARWATCH"  
    **SG TCU**: "FD491, YBWP SARWATCH terminated"
