## Airspace
When RI ADC is active, Restricted Areas R469, R470, and R494 are automatically activated.

RI ADC administers the R470 restricted area when active from SFC to 1500ft. ST TCU (SDN) administers it from 1500ft to 4500ft.

## VFR Procedures
All VFR aircraft inbound, outbound, or transiting the field maintain 1500ft.

Aircraft transiting the RIC CTR track via the northbound or southbound VFR route.  
Aircraft transiting northbound contact RI ADC at NPBR for clearance. Aircraft transiting southbound contact RI ADC at KRMD for clearance.

Further details of the transit route are found in the *ERSA FAC YSRI* and *Sydney VTC*.

### Training Areas
There are three training areas located within R470, used for both civil and military operations.

| Name | Identifier | Vertical Limits |
| ---- | ---------- | --------------- |
| Londonderry Training Area | LDD TA | ``SFC - A015`` |
| Northern Training Area | NTA TA | ``SFC - A060`` |
| Southern Training Area | STA TA | ``SFC - A040`` |

### Circuit Operations
The YSRI circuit area is defined as within 6nm of the YSRI ARP. An aircraft operating in the circuit will be issued a clearance to operate not above 1500ft. Both runways fly a left hand circuit.

## Departures
IFR aircraft planned via ANKUB, KADOM, or MUDGI may be assigned the SID that terminates at the appropriate waypoint. Aircraft that are not planned via these points, are flying VFR, or are negative RNAV, may be assigned a visual departure.
