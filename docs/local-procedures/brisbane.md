</figure>

!!! warning "Important"
    SMC may provide instructions which contradict these standard taxi routes. Ensure you comply with any issued taxi instruction at all times.

#### SMC Frequency Change
Three SMC positions exist at Brisbane, all with different jurisdiction. Aircraft shall expect to hold short of predetermined taxiways. Domestic aircraft should independently transfer to the next SMC controller autonomously, while international aircraft may expect an explicit frequency change from the current SMC.

#### Preferred Runway Exits
The AIRPORT EFFICIENCY PROCEDURES chart dictates preferred runway exits for pilots to vacate at. This ensures a predictable, efficient movement of aircraft on the aerodrome and should be abided by where possible. Where a preferred exit is not assured, pilots must inform ADC.

| Runway | Aircraft Type | Preferred Exits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RWY 01L | Turboprop<br>Jet<br>Heavy Jet | T8<br>T6<br>T4 |
| RWY 01R | Turboprop, Jet<br>Heavy Jet | A4S<br>A4 or A3 |
| RWY 19L | Turboprop, Jet<br>Heavy Jet | A6<br>A7 |
| RWY 19R | Turboprop<br>Jet<br>Heavy Jet | T7<br>T9 <br>T11 |

### Departures
VFR aircraft should expect to depart via a visual departure, on track to their first tracking point.

    **CG ADC:** "WP1, Gold Coast Tower, cleared to YXTV direct, not above A015"  
    **WP1:** "Cleared to YXTV direct, not above A015, WP1"  

Both hospital helipads are outside the maneuvering area and do not require a landing clearance from CG ADC. Helicopters arriving to these helipads will be instructed to "report on the ground" so the controller knows when aircraft are no longer active in their airspace.

!!! phraseology
    **CG ADC:** "WP1, cleared visual approach YXTV, report on the ground"  
    **WP1:** "Cleared visual approach YXTV, wilco, WP1"  

##### Departures

Aircraft departing from hospitals within the Gold Coast CTR must obtain clearance prior to becoming airborne. Aircraft will be subject to delays depending on traffic in the Gold Coast CTR.

Both hospital helipads are outside the maneuvering area and do not require a takeoff clearance from CG ADC, however a clearance to become airborne is required. Helicopters departing from these helipads will be instructed to "report airborne".

!!! phraseology
    **RSCU588:** "Gold Coast Tower, helicopter RSCU588, YXTV, ready for northen departure"  
    **CG ADC:** "RSCU588, Gold Coast Tower, remain on the ground, expect clearance in 3 minutes due traffic"  
    **RSCU588:** "Remain on the ground, RSCU588"

    **AF ADC**: "YQF, cleared visual approach"      
    **YQF**: "Cleared visual approach, YQF"  

If applicable, aircraft may be instructed to maintain `A015`, for separation with aircraft departing the zone `A010`. Once clear of the departure track, AF ADC will instruct aircraft "cleared visual approach", cancelling the previous level restriction.

### Helicopter Operations

Archerfield has three helipads located around the aerodrome:

- **Central Helipad**, on the southern side of Taxiway Foxtrot
- **Northern Helipad**, adjacent the north-eastern end of Runway 04R/22L
- The **Queensland Government Air facility** used by rescue helicopters, north of Taxiway B5

!!! note
    Both the Northern and Central helipads are inside the maneuvering area and treated like a runway, requiring a takeoff and landing clearance from AF ADC. Helicopters operating on other surfaces outside the maneuvering areas will be instructed to "report airborne" or "report on the ground" so the controllers knows when they are active/no longer active in their airspace.

##### Training Areas

There are 3 designated helicopter training areas which can be used for training operations in ground effect and circuits. The active helicopter training area shall be nominated on the ATIS.

=== "Area A"

    **BN TCU**: "FHK, identified, cleared to enter controlled airspace remaining west of SBD, not above `A010`, Brisbane QNH 1026"  
    **FHK**: "Cleared to enter controlled airspace remaining west of SBD, not above `A010`, QNH 1026, FHK"

Due to the close proximity to YBBN, aircraft may be instructed to maintain visual separation with arriving or departing aircraft.

!!! phraseology 
    **BN TCU**: "FHK, report sighting an Embraer E190 departing runway 19R, through `A008` on climb."  
    **FHK**: Traffic in sight, FHK"  
    **BN TCU**: "FHK, maintain own seperation with the E190"  
    **FHK**: "Maintain own seperation, FHK"  

    **BN TCU**: "QFA1864, traffic is a helicopter operating over the CBD not above `A010`, maintaining own separation with you"  
    **QFA1864:** "QFA1864"

Pilots shall report once clear of CTA.

!!! phraseology 
    **FHK**: "FHK, excited the zone"  
    **BN TCU**: "FHK, identification and control service terminated, frequency change approved"  
    **FHK**: "Frequency change approved, FHK"

Aircraft should then transfer to area frequency/advisory frequency.
