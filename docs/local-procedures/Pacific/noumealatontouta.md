## Taxiing
**Taxiways B** and **C** are over a kilometre away from both runway thresholds. Category A and B aircraft, as well B738s and A320s, are permitted to turnaround on the runway at any intermediate point. Other aircraft must backtrack the entire length.

## Runway Modes
Typically reciprocal runway operations occur with **runway 29** departures and **runway 11** arrivals. If weather or traffic levels preclude reciprocal runway operations **Runway 11** shall be used for arrivals and departures, **except** when:

- Tailwind is greather than **10 kts**, or
- Tailwind is greather than **5 kts** and the runway is **wet**.

In those situations, **Runway 29** shall be used for arrivals and departures.

## Departures
Aircraft planned via **GOPRA**, **ONIBA**, **TEPAM**, **NISAS**, **POXAK**, **SCUBA**, or **VIRAR** shall be assigned the **Procedural SID** that terminates at the appropriate waypoint. Aircraft departing to the north-east shall be assigned the **Procedural SID** terminating at **LTO VOR**.

## Arrivals
Aircraft should expect the ILS for **runway 11** and RNP for **runway 12**

### Runway 29 VPT
Aircraft arriving via the **VPT** for Runway 29 will perform an **ILS** or **VOR** approach for Runway 11 before breaking right to follow the prescribed visual track.
