## Taxiing
Aircraft up to, and including, B738s and A320s are permitted to turnaround on the runway at any intermediate point. Other aircraft must backtrack the entire length.

## Runway Modes
Typically reciprocal runway operations occur with **RWY 29** departures and **RWY 11** arrivals. If weather or traffic levels preclude reciprocal runway operations RWY 11 shall be used for arrivals and departures, except where excessive tailwind necessitates the use of RWY 29.

## Departures
Aircraft planned via **GOPRA**, **ONIBA**, **TEPAM**, **NISAS**, **POXAK**, **SCUBA**, or **VIRAR** should expect to be assigned the **Procedural SID** that terminates at the appropriate waypoint. Aircraft departing to the north-east should expect to be assigned the **Procedural SID** terminating at **LTO VOR**.

## Arrivals
ILS, RNP, VOR, and NDB approaches are available to RWY 11. An RNP approach is available to RWY 29.

### Runway 29 VPT
Aircraft arriving via the **VPT** for RWY 29 will perform an **ILS** or **VOR** approach for RWY 11 before breaking right to follow the prescribed visual track.
