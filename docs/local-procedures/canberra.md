## Canberra (YSCB)
### Taxiing
The taxiway layout at YSCB has changed over the years, with taxiway **B** now extending full length along RWY 17/35. If your scenery does not feature this taxiway structure, you must inform **CB SMC** when requesting taxi to runway 17 from the civil aprons.

!!! phraseology
    **QJE1501**: "Canberra Ground, QJE1501, received F, request taxi, require to cross runway 17 at D due scenery limitations"
    
### Departures
VFR aircraft should expect to depart via a visual departure, on track to their first tracking point.

IFR aircraft should expect to be issued with a SID as per below:

| Aircraft Type | Runway | First Waypoint | SID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Jets | All | AVBEG | AVBEG SID |
| Jets | All | CULIN | CULIN SID |

All other aircraft shall expect the **CB (RADAR) SID**.

### Arrivals
An ILS is available to RWY 35 only. RWY 12 does **not** have any associated instrument approaches. RNP approaches are available to RWY 30 & RWY 35. RNP(AR) approaches are available to RWY 17 & RWY 35.

IFR aircraft can generally expect to be processed via a STAR (or for RWY 30, direct to the IAF) terminating with the following approach:

| Runway | Approach |
| --- | --- |
| 17 | RNP(AR) or VOR if unable |
| 30 | RNP |
| 35 | ILS or RNP(AR) |

Light VFR aircraft may be processed to RWY 12 for a visual approach.

## Helicopter Operations
Southcare Helicopter Base (YXSB), Calvary Hospital, and Canberra Hospital are all located inside the Canberra CTR. A clearance must be obtained from **CB ADC** prior to becoming airborne from these locations. Helicopters may be instructed to report sighting and maintain own separation with aircraft operating to/from YSCB.

!!! phraseology
    **RSCU209**: "Canberra Tower, helicopter RSCU209, on the pad at Canberra Hospital, for Bankstown, received Juliet, ready"  
    **CB ADC**: "RSCU209, Canberra Tower, report sighting a Jetstar A320 on a 3nm final runway 35 and advise able to maintain own separation with that aircraft"  
    **RSCU209**: "Traffic sighted and affirm, RSCU209"  
    **CB ADC**: "RSCU209, pass behind the A320, maintain own separation, caution wake turbulence, cleared to Bankstown via AKMIR, flight planned route, climb to A090, squawk 3762"  
    **RSCU209**: "Cleared to Bankstown via AKMIR flight planned route, climb to A090, squawk 3762, pass behind the A320 and maintain own separation, RSCU209"

Inbound helicopters should make contact with **CB TCU** before entering CTA for airways clearance.
