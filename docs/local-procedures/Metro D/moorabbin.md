## Airspace
MB ADC is responsible for the Class D airspace in the MB CTR from `SFC`to `A025`.

When Moorabbin ADC West is online, responsibility for the Runway, Circuit, and Airspace is divided between the two ADC controllers.

**ADC East** takes responsibility for the East Runway, Circuit and Airspace (Runway 17L/35R and 13L/31R).

**ADC West** takes responsibility for the West Runway, Circuit and Airspace (Runway 17R/35L and 13R/31L).

## Taxiing
The runup bays are outside the manoeuvring area, so no taxi instructions are required for initial taxi.

!!! tip
    The YMMB Manoeuvring Area chart can be found on the [CASA Website](https://www.casa.gov.au/moorabbin-manoeuvring-area-map).

Departing aircraft must obtain taxi instructions from SMC prior to leaving the run up bays. Aircraft which do not require run ups must obtain taxi instructions prior to entering the manoeuvring area.

!!! phraseology
    **VCY**: "Moorabbin Ground, VCY, Cessna 152, Southern Runup Bay, for an upwind departure, received Uniform, request taxi"  
    **MB SMC**: "VCY, Moorabbin Ground, taxi to holding point Golf 2, runway 17R"  
    **VCY**: "Taxi to holding point Golf 2, runwy 17R, VCY"

## Departures
VFR aircraft shall generally depart the zone on an extended circuit leg at `A020`.

There are no SIDs at YMMB. IFR or VFR aircraft requesting climb into the overlying or adjacent Class C airspace must obtain an airways clearance from SMC.

### Start Approval
Start approval is required from SMC for:

- Circuit operations
- Airwork in the Melbourne TMA
- Departures to YMML
- Departures to YMEN planned above `A020`

## Arrivals
VFR aircraft shall approach the MB CTR at `A010` and report at BTO, ACE, GMH, CARR, SHOL, or BAW.

Pilots should expect circuit joinining instructions in accordance with the table below:

| Entry Point | RWY 13                          | RWY 17                          | RWY 31                          | RWY 35                          |
|-------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| BTO         | *Final* **13R**                  | *Oblique Base* **17R**            | *Downwind* **31L**                | *Downwind* or *Oblique Downwind* **35L** |
| ACE         | *Base* **13L**                   | *Oblique Base* or *Final* **17L** | *Oblique Downwind* or *Base* **31R** | *Oblique Downwind* **35R**        |
| GMH         | *Oblique Downwind* or *Downwind* **13L** | *Base* **17L**                   | *Oblique Base* or *Final* **31R** | *Base* **35R**                    |
| CARR        | *Oblique Downwind* **13R**       | *Downwind* **17R**                | *Base* *31L**                    | *Final* **35L**                   |
| SHOL       | *Oblique Downwind* or *Base* **13R** | *Oblique Downwind* **17R**       | *Base* **31L**                    | *Oblique Base* or *Final* **35L** |
| BAW         | *Base* or *Oblique Base* **13R** | *Base* or *Oblique Downwind* **17R** | *Oblique Downwind* **31L**         | *Base* **35L**                    |

!!! phraseology
    **EWZ**: "Moorabbin Tower, EWZ, C172, CARR, A015, inbound in receipt of P"  
    **MB ADC**: "EWZ, Moorabbin Tower, join downwind Runway 17R"  
    **EWZ**: "Join downwind Runway 17R, EWZ"  

!!! note
    Circuit joining instructions given without an assigned altitude imply clearance to conduct the visual approach. Pilots may commence a visual approach while complying with any lateral instructions.

## Helicopter Operations
Circuit altitude: `A007`.

Helicopter circuits are conducted from designated areas based on the active runway:

- **RWY 17/35**: From the **Eastern Grass**, which encompasses all areas east of runway 35R.
- **RWY 13/31**: From the **Western Triangle**, which extends:
    - From TWY A to the boundary fence,
    - Up to the centerline of TWY A4,
    - Then across to the edge of TWY B and runs parallel to TWY B to the boundary fence.

Circuit operations are conducted parallel to the duty runway and inside the fixed-wing circuit.

### Process

- Helicopters established on the eastern grass or western triangle do not require clearance for low-level operations below `A001`.
- Pilots must report airborne before each circuit. If departing, they must include intentions. Pilots must stay below `A001` until they are acknowledged.
- Controllers provide traffic information only on initial circuits. ADC does not positively control these operations or provide sequencing.
- After circuit training, pilots should nominate their landing HLS during the airborne call and report downwind before transitioning to the arrival procedure.

!!! tip
    Where traffic permits, helicopters may be instructed to air transit to their designated areas of operations, to expedite their repositioning.

!!! phraseology
    **RJB**: "Moorabbin Tower, RJB, R44, at the southern apron, with information N, request circuits"  
    **MB ADC**: "RJB, Moorabbin Tower, air transit Eastern Grass, report airborne"  
    **RJB**: "Air transit Eastern Grass, RJB"  

    **RJB**: "Moorabbin Tower, RJB, airborne"  
    **MB ADC**: "RJB"

    *RJB, established at the Eastern Grass, becomes airborne for circuits*  
    **RJB**: "RJB, Airborne"  
    **MB ADC**: "RJB"

### Night Circuits
Night operations must comply with fixed wing operations.
