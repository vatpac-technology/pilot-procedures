## Airspace
**CN ADC** is responsible for the Class D airspace within the Camden CTR from `SFC` to `A020`.

### Tower Closed Procedures
When CN ADC is offline, the airspace reverts to Class G. CTAF procedures apply.

## Taxiing
The apron areas are outside the manoeuvring area. The runup bays and all connecting taxiways are inside the manoeuvring area, requiring taxi instructions.

!!! tip
    The YSCN Manoeuvring Area chart can be found on the [CASA Website](https://www.casa.gov.au/camden-manoeuvring-area-map). 

Start approval is required for all flights intending to operate in the circuit area.

!!! phraseology  
    **WKM**: "Camden Ground, Citabria WKM, at the fuel bowser, received information Echo, request start up and taxi for circuits."  
    **CN SMC**: "WKM, Camden Ground, start approved, taxi to holding point E, Runway 24."

Aircraft above 5700kg MTOW must only use TWY D between RWY 06/24 and TWY F.

## Departures
Departures shall advise their intentions with their ready call. 

!!! phraseology
    **WKM**: "Camden Tower, WKM, holding point Echo, Ready Runway 24, circuits."  
    OR  
    **VMS**: "Tower, VMS, holding point Echo, Runway 24, ready for crosswind departure."

All departing aircraft shall depart and climb to `A013`.

Tower will often issue "Depart on climb" instructions to aircraft leaving the CTR. This gives the pilot permission to leave the CN CTR on climb vertically as well as laterally.

VFR aircraft departing into Class G airspace depart the CTR on an extended leg of the circuit. Clearance for VFR aircraft to operate in the CN CTR and VFR aircraft departing into Class G will be issued on CN ADC frequency.

Left hand circuits are required for powered aircraft operating RWY 06 and RWY 10.  
Right hand circuits are required for powered aircraft operating RWY 24 and RWY 28.

All aircraft departing the CTR into Class G airspace are to change to an appropriate SY TCU frequency when leaving the CTR. Specific transfer instructions will not be issued to VFR aircraft.

Aircraft, other than gliders and tugs, must not infringe the glider circuit below 2300ft.

## Arrivals
Arriving VFR aircraft should track via and report at BRY, MYF, MEG, PIC, or THK.

Arriving aircraft shall enter the circuit descending to or maintaining 1800ft.

When arriving via a VFR inbound point, pilots should expect the following circuit instructions:

| VFR Inbound Point | RWY 06 | RWY 24 |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------ |
| BRY | "Join downwind RWY 06, maintain 1800ft, report 2NM" | "Join final RWY 24, maintain 1800ft, report Oran Park (ONPK)" |
| MYF | "Join base RWY 06, maintain 1800ft, report 2NM" | "Join base RWY 24, maintain 1800ft, report 2NM" |
| MEG | "Overfly Camden to join mid-field crosswind RWY 06, maintain 1800ft, report overhead" | "Overfly Camden to join mid-field crosswind RWY 24, maintain 1800ft, report overhead" |
| PIC | "Overfly Camden to join mid-field crosswind RWY 06, maintain 1800ft, report overhead" | "Overfly Camden to join mid-field crosswind RWY 24, maintain 1800ft, report overhead" |
| THK | "Join final RWY 06, maintain 1800ft, report 3NM" | "Join downwind RWY 24, maintain 1800ft, report 2NM" |

ATC may omit the requirement to maintain 1800ft if pilots report inbound for a full stop and instead clear the pilot for a visual approach.

ATC may also omit the instruction if the circuit is not busy and a pilot reports inbound for touch and goes.

!!! phraseology  
    **MWY**: "Camden Tower, Citabria MWY, inbound via MYF, descending 1800, received Golf, for a full stop."  
    **CN ADC**: "MWY, Camden Tower, join base for Runway 24, maintain 1800, report 2 miles."  
    **MWY**: "Join base Runway 24, maintain 1800, report 2 miles, MWY."  
    **MWY**:, "MWY, 2 miles."  
    **CN ADC**: "MWY, cleared visual approach."

!!! phraseology  
    **RRW**: "Camden Tower, Citabria RRW, inbound via MEG, 1800, received Golf, for circuits."  
    **CN ADC**: "RRW, Camden Tower, overfly to join mid-field crosswind runway 24, report overhead."  
    **RRW**: "Join mid-field crosswind and report overhead, RRW."  
    **RRW**: "RRW, overhead, touch and go."  
    **CN ADC**: "RRW, cleared touch and go."

## Glider Operations
Glider aircraft and their towplanes will utilise two independent grass glider runways on the Southwestern side of the aerodrome. Both glider runways are parallel to either main runway.

Right hand circuits are required for gliders and tugs operating on glider strips 06 and 10. 

Simultaneous operations from both parallel glider strips. **Contra circuits are in use at all times. There is no dead side with contra circuits.**

Glider and tug circuits are flown to the South or Southeast, other aircraft circuits to the North or Northwest.

Outside the lateral limits of CN CTR, gliders operate throughout the surrounding and overlying Class G airspace.

ATC responsibilities to aircraft engaged in gliding activity are limited to passing relevant traffic information after the intention to land has been notified.  
The normal requirements on entry to the CTR do not apply to gliders. Gliders must report entering the CTR and downwind.

!!! warning "Caution"
    Gliders landing on glider strip 28 cross RWY 28 threshold.  
    Aircraft operating on RWY 10 are not visible to aircraft departing glider strip 06.  
    Aircraft on RWY 24 and on final for RWY 24 are not visible to aircraft on RWY 28.  
    Aircraft on RWY 28 and on final for RWY 28 are not visible to aircraft on RWY 24.  
    When RWY 06 or 24 in use, gliders and tailwheels may require strips 10 or 28 due to crosswind component.  
    Helicopters may conduct low level operations in the Southwest corner of the aerodrome.

## Helicopter Operations
Helicopter altitude is 1000ft on CN QNH HJ; 1300ft CN QNH HN.  
During HJ, helicopters must use the helicopter circuit which is established inside the fixed wing circuit.  
During HN, helicopters must conform to the fixed wing circuit.

## IFR Operations & Instrument Approaches
During tower hours, IFR aircraft will receive an airways clearance from CN SMC or ADC.

The only instrument approach at YSCN is the RNP-W approach. This approach commences OCTA and enters the CN CTR.

SY TCU **will not** clear aircraft for the approach and will transfer aircraft to CN ADC at SCNWI. CN ADC shall issue airways clearance on first contact in accordance with the table below:

| Scenario | Clearance |
| -------- | --------- |
| Aircraft is visual and circuit traffic exists | "Cleared RNP-W approach, not below 1800ft" |
| Aircraft not visual or no circuit traffic | "Cleared RNP-W approach, Runway 06/24" |
