## Airspace
PF ADC is responsible for the Class D airspace in the PF CTR `SFC` to `A015`.

When ADC West is online, the airspace is divided down the middle of the two active extended runway centerlines.

### Tower Closed Procedures
When PF ADC is offline, the airspace reverts to Class G. CTAF procedures apply.

## Taxiing
The apron areas are outside the manoeuvring area. The runup bays and all connecting taxiways are inside the manoeuvring area, requiring taxi instructions.

!!! tip
    The YPPF Manoeuvring Area chart can be found on the [CASA Website](https://www.casa.gov.au/parafield-manoeuvring-area-map).

The undershoots of RWY 26L & 26R on taxiway B require a clearance to cross.

## Departures
VFR aircraft shall depart the zone via the SUB or SKI departure.

| Departure Runway | SUB Departure | SKI Departure |
| -- | -- | -- |
| RWY 03R | From upwind, track direct to SUB, climb to A015. | From left crosswind, track south of Bolivar Strobe to SKI, climb to A010. |
| RWY 08L | From left crosswind, track direct to SUB, climb to A010. Once north of PF, climb to A015. | From left downwind, track south of Bolivar Strobe to SKI, climb to A010. |
| RWY 21R | From left downwind, track direct to SUB, climb to A010. Once east of PF, climb to A015. | From right crosswind, track south of Bolivar Strobe to SKI, climb to A010. |
| RWY 26R | From right crosswind, track direct to SUB, climb to A010. Once north of PF, climb to A015. | From upwind, track south of Bolivar Strobe to SKI, climb to A010. |

Pilots must advise ADC of intended departure procedure on first contact.

!!! phraseology
    **WHB**: "Parafield Tower, Cessna 172 WHB, holding point J1 RWY 08L, for SUB departure, ready"

!!! note
    A takeoff clearance constitutes a clearance to depart the control zone by extending the pilot's requested leg of the circuit.  Aircraft departing the zone into Class G airspace should transfer to area frequency/advisory frequency upon leaving the zone. **No explicit frequency transfer will be given to these aircraft**.

Pilots may request departure into the overlying Class C CTA through an explicit airways clearance. This may be available (pending traffic) on track to the first filed waypoint or via the Hope Valley [VFR Route](#hope-valley-route).

## Arrivals
VFR aircraft should report inbound at OHB, DMW, or EDN (outside EDN tower hours) at `A015`, and expect to be instructed to join the circuit.

Pilots inbound via OHB must remain south of Bolivar Strobe. Pilots must remain clear of the SUB-SPR and PF-SKI tracks due to outbound aircraft.

## IFR Operations
### Departures
IFR aircraft should expect to be issued with the **PF (RADAR) SID** from RWY 03L or 21R.

By day VMC, pilots may request a visual departure.

### Arrivals
An RNP & NDB approach is available to RWY 21R. A VOR approach is available to the circling area.

By day VMC, pilots should expect to arrive in accordance with [VFR Arrivals](#arrivals_1).

## Hope Valley Route
A VFR [Lane of Entry](../../airspace/lanesofentry.md) is established leading from the PF CTR to MLT, contained entirely inside the AD CTR. **A clearance is required to operate on this route**. 

Pilots may be instructed to sight and maintain own separation with aircraft operating into or outbound from YPAD.
