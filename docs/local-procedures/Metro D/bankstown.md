## Airspace
BK ADC is responsible for the Class D airspace in the BK CTR `SFC` to `A015`.

When BK ADC (Circuit) is online, responsibility for the **Runway**, **Circuit**, and **Airspace** is divided between the two ADC controllers.

ADC (Circuit) takes responsibility for the southern Runway, Circuit and Airspace (Runway **11R/29L**) at or below `A010`. ADC North takes responsibility for all other airspace.

The ATIS will indicate the current runway config and nominate what each parallel runway is being used for. 

| Runway | Use |
| ------ | --- |
| Northern Runway (11L/29R) | VFR arrivals/departures |
| Southern Runway (11R/29L) | Circuit training |
| Centre Runway (11C/29C) | IFR arrivals/departures and VFR overflow |

### Tower Closed Procedures
When BK ADC is offline, the airspace reverts to Class G. CTAF procedures apply.

## Taxiing
The apron areas are outside the manoeuvring area. The runup bays and all connecting taxiways are inside the manoeuvring area, requiring taxi instructions.

!!! tip
    The YSBK Manoeuvring Area chart can be found on the [CASA Website](https://www.casa.gov.au/bankstown-manoeuvring-area-map).

A runway crossing clearance is **not** required when taxiing under the runway undershoots on taxiway B or E.

Aircraft vacating RWY 11C/29C must **hold short** of any adjacent runway and remain on **ADC** frequency, who will issue explicit runway crossing instructions.

## Departures
VFR aircraft shall depart the CTR on an extended leg of the circuit at the following altitude.

| Duty Runway Direction | Outbound Altitude |
| --- | --- |
| RWY 11 | `A015` |
| RWY 29 | `A010` |

!!! note
    A takeoff clearance constitutes a clearance to depart the control zone by extending the pilot's requested leg of the circuit.  Aircraft departing the zone into Class G airspace should transfer to area frequency/advisory frequency upon leaving the zone. **No explicit frequency transfer will be given to these aircraft**.

!!! warning "Important"
    The Bankstown CTR is bordered to the east and south by the Sydney CTR. All VFR aircraft must depart to the west or northwest unless in receipt of an airways clearance.

### Start Approval
Start approval is required for all flights intending to operate in the circuit area.

!!! phraseology  
    **LKU**: "Bankstown Ground, Warrior LKU, for circuits, received Echo, request engine start"  
    **BK SMC**: "LKU, Bankstown Ground, start approved"  
    **LKU**: "Start approved, LKU"

## Arrivals
Arriving VFR aircraft should track via and report at PSP or 2RN, at the following altitude.

| Duty Runway Direction | Outbound Altitude |
| --- | --- |
| RWY 11 | `A010` |
| RWY 29 | `A015` |

When arriving via a VFR inbound point, pilots should expect the following circuit instructions:

| VFR Approach Point | RWY 29  | RWY 11 |
| ----------------| --------- | ---------- |
| PSP    | *"Join right downwind runway 29R, maintain `A015`"*, then when abeam RWYs 11 threshold or clear of departing traffic, *"Cleared visual approach"*       | *"Join final runway 11L, report 3nm"*        |
| TWRN   | *"Join crosswind runway 29R, maintain `A015`"*, then when abeam RWYs 11 threshold or clear of departing traffic, *"Cleared visual approach"* | *"Join final runway 11L, report at Warwick Farm"*  |

!!! note
    Aircraft joining final in the RWY 11 direction are not assigned a level and are expected to commence a visual approach in accordance with the tracking instructions issued by ADC. Aircraft should enter the control zone at `A010` to avoid outbound aircraft maintaining `A015`. 

!!! phraseology  
    **TEK**: "Bankstown Tower, Warrior TEK, 2RN, `A010`, inbound, received Golf"  
    **BK ADC**: "TEK, Bankstown Tower, join final RWY 11L, report at Warwick Farm"  
    **TEK**: "Join final RWY 11L, TEK"  

    **BK ADC**: "TEK, RWY 11L, cleared to land"  
    **TEK**: "RWY 11L, cleared to land, TEK"

## Circuits
All circuits are to be flown at `A010`.

| Runway | Day  | Night |
| ----------------| --------- | ---------- |
| RWY 11L    | Left       | -        |
| RWY 11C   | Left | Right  |
| RWY 11R    | Right | -  |
| RWY 29L     | Left        | -  |
| RWY 29C    | Right | Left         |
| RWY 29R    | Right        | -  |

## Helicopter Operations
### General
These procedures apply during hours of daylight only. During hours of darkness, all helicopters must revert to fixed-wing operations.  

The Main Pad (abeam taxiway Mike) is treated like a runway and requires a takeoff/landing clearance. Helicopters are permitted to become airborne from a limited number of other locations on the aerodrome, such as taxiway November Two, and will be instructed to *"report airborne"* or *"report on the ground"*.

### Reporting Points
Three helicopter reporting points help keep helicopters segregated from other traffic.  

- **CWST**: Michels Patisserie located 1.2nm west of CNTH on the water pipeline  
- **CNTH**: Northern end of Regents Park Railway Station, roughly 300 metres north of the water pipeline  
- **CSTH**: Intersection of two creeks enclosing a sewage treatment works 2.1nm south of the aerodrome reference point

### Inbound Procedures
Helicopters should track inbound at `A007` via one of the normal inbound points (PSP or TWRN) or via *Olympic Park* and report to **BK ADC** at that point. In response, **BK ADC** will instruct the aircraft to track as below:

| Inbound Point | RWY 11 | RWY 29 |
| ----------------| --------- | ---------- |
| PSP | *"Report CWST"*, then <br>*"Join base main pad"* | *"Report CNTH"*, then <br>*"Join base main pad"* |
| TWRN | *"Report CSTH, `A005`"*, then <br>*"Overfly midfield at `A005`, join downwind main pad"* | *"Report CSTH, `A005`"*, then <br>*"Overfly midfield at `A005`, join downwind main pad"* |
| *Olympic Park* | *"Report CWST"*, then <br>*"Join base main pad"* | *"Report CNTH"*, then <br>*"Join base main pad"* |

!!! note
    Helicopters tracking via CSTH will pass over the runway complex midfield at `A005` to join downwind. Traffic information will be provided on aircraft operating to the runways below.

### Outbound Procedures
Helicopters should track outbound via one of the helicopter reporting points at `A007`. Departures to the north must track via CWST when RWY 29s are in use and CNTH when RWY 11s are in use.

Helicopters shall report ready to **BK ADC** with their departure intentions. In response, **BK ADC** will clear the aircraft for takeoff and instruct them to track via the appropriate exit gate.

!!! phraseology
    **YZD:** "Bankstown Tower, helicopter YZD, main pad, for Choppers North departure, ready"  
    **BK ADC:** "YZD, Bankstown Tower, depart Choppers North, main pad, cleared for takeoff"

!!! note
    Helicopters tracking via CSTH will pass over the runway complex midfield at `A005` to join downwind. Traffic information will be provided on aircraft operating to the runways below.

### Circuits
Circuits are conducted within the lateral confines of the fixed-wing circuit at `A007`, in the same direction as the current runway config. The termination point of the circuit is the Main Pad.

!!! phraseology
    **BK ADC:** "SUA, main pad, cleared stop and go"

## IFR Operations
IFR aircraft should request airways clearance from **BK SMC** with their taxi request.

!!! phraseology
    **FD213**: "Bankstown Ground, FD213, taxiway Charlie, for Dubbo, received Echo, request taxi and airways clearance"  
    **BK SMC**: "FD213, Bankstown Ground, cleared to Dubbo via KADOM, flight planned route, BK1 departure, climb via SID to `A030`, squawk 3244, taxi via A8, hold short RWY 29R"  
    **FD213**: "Cleared to Dubbo via KADOM, flight planned route, BK1 departure, climb via SID to `A030`, squawk 3244, taxi via A8, hold short RWY 29R, FD213"

All IFR aircraft shall expect the **BK (RADAR) SID**.

An RNP and NDB approach is available to RWY 11C. An NDB approach is available to the circling area.

!!! note
    The NDB-A approach commences from inside the SY CTR and requires a clearance from **SY TCU**. Significant delays may be expected due to traffic operating into or out of YSSY.

    Aircraft in CTA intending to conduct the RNP approach may be instructed to leave CTA descending prior to commencing the approach due to traffic operating into or out of YSSY.

## Lane of Entry
A [lane of entry](../../airspace/lanesofentry.md) exists to facilitate the transit of VFR aircraft between YSBK and positions north. Northbound traffic must transit via the eastern lane, southbound aircraft must transit via the western lane. 

The lane is flown OCTA, clearances are not required. Pilots should broadcast their position and intentions when joining the lane, and in response to any conflicting traffic, on the advisory frequency.

!!! warning "Important"
    Pilots must ensure they remain **below** the CTA steps, particularly when flying southbound.
