## Airspace
AF ADC is responsible for the Class D airspace in the AF CTR `SFC` to `A015`.

When Archerfield ADC North is online, responsibility for the **Runway**, **Circuit**, and **Airspace** is divided between the two ADC controllers.

ADC South takes responsibility for the South/East Runway, Circuit and Airspace (Runway **10R**, **28L**, **04R**, **22L**).

ADC North takes responsibility for the North/West Runway, Circuit and Airspace (Runway **10L**, **28R**, **04L**, **22R**).

### Tower Closed Procedures
When AF ADC is offline, the airspace reverts to Class G. CTAF procedures apply.

## Taxiing
The apron areas are outside the manoeuvring area. The runup bays and all connecting taxiways are inside the manoeuvring area, requiring taxi instructions. All aircraft require a clearance to cross RWY 04L & 04R on taxiway B and RWY 10L on A8/B8. 

Aircraft may taxi past the undershoot of RWY 28L on the southern apron without clearance, provided the pilot is satisfied that no risk of collision exists. 

!!! tip
    The YBAF Manoeuvring Area chart can be found on the [CASA Website](https://www.casa.gov.au/archerfield-manoeuvring-area-map).

!!! warning
    In some simulator scenery holding point **B6** is incorrect or entirely missing. If your scenery does not support this holding point, you must inform **AF SMC** when requesting taxi when RWY 10L is in use. 

## Departures
| Planned Departure Tracks | Departure   | Tracking Requirement | 
| ---------------      | ---------      | ----------           | 
| BTN 310 & 019 DEG    | Northern Departure | Track via WTBG | 
| BTN 020 & 099 DEG    | Eastern Departure  | Track via Gateway Motorway and Pacific Motorway Intersection<br>*(Not available when RWY 22 is active, unless departing into Class C)* | 
| BTN 100 & 204 DEG    | Southern Departure | Track 135 until clear of the zone |
| BTN 205 & 309 DEG    | Western Departure  | Track between 220 & 309 until clear of the zone<br>*(Aircraft must nominate outbound departure track with taxi call)* |
| Other                |                    | As approved by ATC

Aircraft shall advise planned departure intentions to AF SMC when requesting taxi.

!!! phraseology
    **BJZ:** "Archer Ground, Seminole BJZ, Eastern Apron, received F, for eastern departure, request taxi"  
    **AF ADC:** "BJZ, Archer Ground, taxi holding point B2, runway 28R"  
    **BJZ:** "Taxi holding point B2, runway 28R, BJZ" 

Aircraft shall confirm departure intentions to AF ADC on initial contact. All VFR departures shall depart the AF CTR at `A010`. 

!!! phraseology
    **R8489**: "Archer Tower, R8489, holding point A7, runway 10R, for eastern departure, ready"  
    **AF ADC**: "R8489, Archer Tower, runway 10R, cleared for takeoff"      
    **R8489**: "Runway 10R, cleared for takeoff, R8489"  

!!! note 
    Aircraft departing the zone into Class G airspace should transfer to area frequency/advisory frequency upon leaving the zone. No explicit frequency transfer will be given to these aircraft.

## Arrivals
Aircraft shall track via any designated VFR inbound reporting point at `A015`, thence contact AF ADC for clearance. Aircraft inbound via TVT may be instructed to report overhead CBRG, or via PKR, report overhead Logan Motorway. All Aircraft can expect to be instructed to join the circuit.

| VFR Waypoint  | Inbound Direction |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| TVT     | North  |
| PKR     | South  |
| TAR     | East   |
| GON     | West   |

!!! warning
    Caution must be exercised when tracking from PKR inbound YBAF, as Greenbank Firing Range restricted area (R627) is located a short distance to the west. Pilots should remain east of a prominent rail line abeam Greenbank, running south to north towards YBAF, to remain clear of R627.

!!! phraseology
    **YQF**: "Archer Tower, YQF, Cirrus, TAR, `A015`, recieved Bravo, inbound fullstop"  
    **AF ADC**: "YQF, Archer Tower, join downwind, runway 10L, maintain `A015`"      
    **YQF**: "Join downwind, runway 10L, maintain `A015`, YQF"  
  
    **AF ADC**: "YQF, cleared visual approach"      
    **YQF**: "Cleared visual approach, YQF"  

If applicable, aircraft may be instructed to maintain `A015`, for separation with aircraft departing the zone `A010`. Once clear of the departure track, AF ADC will instruct aircraft "cleared visual approach", cancelling the previous level restriction.

## Helicopter Operations
Archerfield has three helipads located around the aerodrome:

- **Northern Helipad**, adjacent the north-eastern end of Runway 04R/22L.
- **Central Helipad**, on the southern side of Taxiway Foxtrot.
- The **LifeFlight Maintenance Base** and **Queensland Government Air facility** used by rescue helicopters, north of Taxiway B6 and B5.

!!! note
    Both the Northern and Central helipads are inside the manoeuvring area and treated like a runway, requiring a takeoff and landing clearance from AF ADC. Helicopters operating on other surfaces outside the manoeuvring areas will be instructed to "report airborne" or "report on the ground" so the controllers knows when they are active/no longer active in their airspace.

#### Training Areas
There are 2 designated helicopter training areas which can be used for helicopter training operations in ground effect and circuits. The ATIS will indicate the current state of the helicopter circuit area.

#### Circuits

Circuit operations are conducted parallel to the duty runway not above `A007` and inside the fixed-wing circuit. Once established within Northern Grass or Eastern Grass, helicopters may operate in ground effect, maintaining a listening watch with ADC. ATC will not positively control helicopter takeoff and landings from the training areas or provide sequencing instructions. Initial traffic information only will be provided on other helicopters conducting circuits, and a continuous lookout for airborne traffic is the responsibility of the pilot. 

Once established, the only call is an airborne call before each circuit. Pilots must report airborne before each circuit. If departing, they must include their departure intentions.

!!! phraseology 
    **FHK:** "Archer Tower, helicopter FHK, northern pad, for northern grass, ready"  
    **AF ADC:** "FHK, Archer Tower, air transit northern grass, report established, northern pad, cleared for takeoff"  
    **FHK:** "Air transit northern grass, wilco, northern pad, cleared for takeoff, FHK"

    **FHK:** "FHK, established"  
    **AF ADC:**" "FHK"  

    *FHK becomes airborne for circuits*  
    **FHK:** "FHK, airborne"  
    **AF ADC:** "FHK"

After circuit training, pilots shall nominate their landing HLS during the airborne call and transition to the arrival procedure.

!!! phraseology 
    **FHK:** "FHK airborne, request northern pad"  
    **AF ADC:** "FHK track direct northern pad, cleared to land"  
    **FHK:** "Track direct northern pad, cleared to land, FHK"

#### Departures
Helicopters depart the zone via any of the [designated outbound routes](#departures). Departures shall be parallel to and clear of the duty runways. 

!!! phraseology 
    **TUY:** "Archer Tower, helicopter TUY, northen pad, for eastern departure, ready"  
    **AF ADC:** "TUY, Archer Tower, depart east, parallel to runway 10L, northen pad, cleared for takeoff"  
    **TUY:** "Depart east, parallel to runway 10L, cleared for takeoff, northen pad, TUY"

##### Uni Departure
Departures with intended entry into BN CTR northbound shall depart the zone via the **Uni Departure**. Aircraft on the Uni Departure depart via UQLD at `A010`, then contact BN TCU for airways clearance.

#### Arrivals
Helicopters enter the zone from any of the designated inbound reporting points. Pilots shall nominate their desired HLS on first contact with AF ADC. If necessary, helicopters may expect to be instructed to overfly the runway complex not below `A005` for a short circuit to the designated HLS.

!!! phraseology 
    **82Y:** "Archer Tower, helicopter 82Y, TAR, `A010`, recieved Foxtrot, inbound northern pad"  
    **AF ADC:** "82Y, Archer Tower, track direct northen pad, report 1 mile"  
    **82Y:** "Track direct northern pad, 82Y"  

    **82Y:** "82Y, 1 mile, northern pad"  
    **AF ADC:** "82Y, cleared to land northern pad"  
    **82Y:** "Cleared to land northen pad, 82Y"

Helicopters inbound for the LifeFlight Maintenance Base or Queensland Government Air facility HLS shall expect a standard fixed wing circuit instruction for the applicable duty runway, complying with fixed wing operations unless another approach is requested or desired.

Helicopters inbound from the south via PKR for either the northen or central helipad shall expect to *"cross 10L and 10R"* alongside any other tracking or traffic information.

!!! phraseology
    **SMD:** "Archer Tower, helicopter SMD, PKR `A015`, recieved Golf, inbound central pad"  
    **AF ADC:** "SMD, Archer Tower, report Logan Motorway"  
    **SMD:** "Report Logan Motorway, SMD"  

    **SMD:** "SMD, Logan Motorway"  
    **AF ADC:** "SMD, track direct central pad, cross 10L and 10R"  
    **SMD:** "Track direct central pad, crossing 10L and 10R, SMD"
