## Airspace
AF ADC is responsible for the Class D airspace in the AF CTR `SFC` to `A015`.

When Archerfield ADC North is online, responsibility for the **Runway**, **Circuit**, and **Airspace** is divided between the two ADC controllers.

ADC South takes responsibility for the South/East Runway, Circuit and Airspace (Runway **10R**, **28L**, **04R**, **22L**).

ADC North takes responsibility for the North/West Runway, Circuit and Airspace (Runway **10L**, **28R**, **04L**, **22R**).

### Tower Closed Procedures
When AF ADC is offline, the airspace reverts to Class G. CTAF procedures apply.

## Taxiing
The apron areas are outside the manoeuvring area. The runup bays and all connecting taxiways are inside the manoeuvring area, requiring taxi instructions. All aircraft require a clearance to cross RWY 04L & 04R on taxiway B.

!!! tip
    The YBAF Manoeuvring Area chart can be found on the [CASA Website](https://www.casa.gov.au/archerfield-manoeuvring-area-map).

!!! warning
    In some simulator scenery holding point **B6** is incorrect or entirely missing. If your scenery does not support this holding point, you must inform **AF SMC** when requesting taxi when RWY 10L is in use. 

## Departures
| Planned Departure Tracks | "Intentions"   | Tracking Requirement | 
| ---------------      | ---------      | ----------           | 
| BTN 310 & 019 DEG    | Northern Departure | Track via WTBG | 
| BTN 020 & 099 DEG    | Eastern <br> Departure  | Track via Gateway Motorway and Pacific Motorway Intersection<br>*(Not available when RWY 22 is active, unless departing into Class C)* | 
| BTN 100 & 204 DEG    | Southern Departure | Track 135 until clear of the zone |
| BTN 205 & 309 DEG    | Western Departure  | Track between 220 & 309 until clear of the zone<br>*(Aircraft must nominate outbound departure track with taxi call)* |
| Other                |                    | As approved by ATC

Aircraft shall advise planned departure intentions to AF SMC when requesting taxi.

!!! phraseology
    **BHK**: "Archer Ground, Archer BHK, Dual, received F, at Eastern Apron, for southern departure, request taxi"    
    **AF SMC**: "BHK, Archer Ground, report approaching taxiway E"  
    **BHK**: "Report approaching E, BHK"        

    **BHK**: "BHK, approaching E"  
    **AF SMC**: "BHK, taxi E, B, cross runway 04R, 04L, holding point B6, runway 10L"   
    **BHK**: "Taxi E, B, cross runway 04R, 04L, holding point B6, runway 10L, BHK"  

Aircraft shall confirm departure intentions to AF ADC on initial contact. All VFR departures shall depart the AF CTR at `A010`. 

!!! phraseology
    **R8489**: "Archer Tower, R8489, holding point A7, runway 10R, for eastern departure, ready"  
    **AF ADC**: "R8489, Archer Tower, runway 10R, cleared for takeoff"      
    **R8489**: "Runway 10R, cleared for takeoff, R8489"  

!!! note 
    Aircraft departing the zone into Class G airspace should transfer to area frequency/advisory frequency upon leaving the zone. No explicit frequency transfer will be given to these aircraft.

## Arrivals
Aircraft shall track via any designated VFR inbound reporting point at `A015`, thence contact AF ADC for clearance. Aircraft inbound via TVT may be instructed to report overhead CBRG, or via PKR, report overhead Logan Motorway. All Aircraft can expect to be instructed to join the circuit.

| VFR Waypoint  | Inbound Direction |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| TVT     | North  |
| PKR     | South  |
| TAR     | East   |
| GON     | West   |

!!! warning
    Caution must be exercised when tracking from PKR inbound YBAF, as Greenbank Firing Range restricted area (R627) is located a short distance to the west.

!!! phraseology
    **YQF**: "Archer Tower, YQF, Cirrus, TAR, A015, recieved Bravo, inbound fullstop"  
    **AF ADC**: "YQF, Archer Tower, join downwind, runway 10L, maintain A015"      
    **YQF**: "Join downwind, runway 10L, maintain A015, YQF"  
  
    **AF ADC**: "YQF, cleared visual approach"      
    **YQF**: "Cleared visual approach, YQF"  

If applicable, aircraft may be instructed to maintain `A015`, for separation with aircraft departing the zone `A010`. Once clear of the departure track, AF ADC will instruct aircraft "cleared visual approach", cancelling the previous level restriction.

## Helicopter Operations
Archerfield has three helipads located around the aerodrome:

- **Central Helipad**, on the southern side of Taxiway Foxtrot
- **Northern Helipad**, adjacent the north-eastern end of Runway 04R/22L
- The **Queensland Government Air facility** used by rescue helicopters, north of Taxiway B5

!!! note
    Both the Northern and Central helipads are inside the maneuvering area and treated like a runway, requiring a takeoff and landing clearance from AF ADC. Helicopters operating on other surfaces outside the maneuvering areas will be instructed to "report airborne" or "report on the ground" so the controllers knows when they are active/no longer active in their airspace.

#### Training Areas
There are 3 designated helicopter training areas which can be used for training operations in ground effect and circuits. The active helicopter training area shall be nominated on the ATIS.

=== "Area A"

    | Lateral Boundary | Vertical Limit  | Capacity     |
    | ------| ---- | --------|
    | North of Taxiway B within the confines of the aerodrome boundary, clear of all buildings  | Not above `A005`  | 3 helicopters in the circuit area, and additionally 2 helicopters in ground effect  |

=== "Area B"

    | Lateral Boundary | Vertical Limit  | Capacity     |
    | ------| ---- | --------|
    | North and west of Runway 04L within the confines of the aerodrome boundary, clear of all buildings  | Not above `A005`  | 3 helicopters in the circuit area, and additionally 2 helicopters in ground effect  |

=== "Area C"

    | Lateral Boundary | Vertical Limit  | Capacity     |
    | ------| ---- | --------|
    | South and east of Taxiway D, inside the fixed <br> wing circuit for Runway 04R/22L, east of the <br> control tower, *All landings to be conducted north of Taxiway B*  | Not above `A008`  | 2 helicopters  |

#### Departures
Helicopters depart the zone via any of the designated outbound routes. Departures shall be parallel to and clear of the duty runways.

##### Uni Departure
Departures with intended entry into BN CTR northbound shall depart the zone via the **Uni Departure**. Aircraft on the Uni Departure depart via UQLD at `A010`, then contact BN TCU for airways clearance.

!!! phraseology 
    **TUY:** "Archer Tower, helicopter TUY, northen pad, for uni departure, ready"  
    **AF ADC:** "TUY, Archer Tower, northen pad, cleared for takeoff"  
    **TUY:** "Cleared for takeoff, northen pad, TUY"

#### Arrivals
Helicopters enter the zone from any of the designated inbound reporting points. Pilots shall nominate their desired HLS on first contact with AF ADC. If necessary, helicopters may expect to be instructed to overfly the runway complex not below `A005` for a short circuit to the designated HLS.

!!! phraseology 
    **82Y:** "Archer Tower, helicopter 82Y, UQLD A010, recieved Foxtrot, inbound northern pad"  
    **AF ADC:** "82Y, Archer Tower, track direct northen pad, report 1 mile"  
    **82Y:** "Track direct northern pad, 82Y"  

    **82Y:** "82Y, 1 mile, northern pad"  
    **AF ADC:** "82Y, cleared to land northern pad"  
    **82Y:** "Cleared to land northen pad, 82Y"

## Circuits
The circuit direction changes depending on time of day and runway being used.

| Runway | Day  | Night |
| ----------------| --------- | ---------- |
| 04R             | Right | -  |
| 04L             | Left  | -  |
