## Airspace
JT ADC is responsible for the Class D airspace in the JT CTR `SFC` to `A015`.

When Jandakot ADC (Circuit) is online, responsibility for the **Runway**, **Circuit**, and **Airspace** is divided between the two ADC controllers.

ADC West takes responsibility for the North-West Runway, Circuit and Airspace (Runway **06L/24R**), and the entire **JT CTR** at `A015`.

ADC (Circuit) takes responsibility for the South-East Runway, Circuit and Airspace (Runway **06R/24L**) at or below `A010`.

### Tower Closed Procedures
When JT ADC is offline, the airspace reverts to Class G. CTAF procedures apply.

## Taxiing
The apron areas are outside the manoeuvring area. The runup bays and all connecting taxiways are inside the manoeuvring area, requiring taxi instructions.

!!! tip
    The YPJT Manoeuvring Area chart can be found on the [CASA Website](https://www.casa.gov.au/jandakot-manoeuvring-area-map).

## Departures
VFR aircraft shall generally depart the zone on an extended circuit leg at `A010`, except for those tracking via FREM.

Aircraft departing via FREM shall track from the circuit to *Fiona Stanley Hospital*, then climb to `A015` and track to FREM.

!!! note
    A takeoff clearance constitutes a clearance to depart the control zone by extending the pilot's requested leg of the circuit.  Aircraft departing the zone into Class G airspace should transfer to area frequency/advisory frequency upon leaving the zone. **No explicit frequency transfer will be given to these aircraft**.

## Arrivals
VFR aircraft should report inbound at BOAT, POWR, OAKF or RUSS at `A015`. JT ADC will instruct aircraft to maintain `A015` and report again at ADWD when inbound from BOAT or POWR, or FDL when inbound from OAKF or RUSS.

Aircraft should expect to join the circuit as below:

| VFR Approach Point | RWYs 06  | RWYs 24 | RWY 12 | RWY 30 |
| ----------------| --------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------- |
| ADWD   | *"Join base runway 06L"* | *"Join right downwind runway 24R, maintain `A015`"*, until the aircraft are clear of RWY 24R departures via *Fiona Stanley Hospital* and FREM, then *"Cleared Visual Approach"*  | *"Join final runway 12"* | *"Join downwind ruwnay 30, maintain `A015`"*, until the aircraft is clear of RWY 30 departures via YGB, then *"Cleared Visual Approach"* |
| FDL  | *"Join downwind runway 06L, maintain `A015`"*. Aircraft should fly overhead the airfield between the control tower and the upwind end of the runway and join the circuit. Once established in the circuit, *"Cleared visual approach"* | *"Join right downwind runway 24R, maintain `A015`"*. Aircraft should fly overhead the airfield between the control tower and the upwind end of the runway and join the circuit. Once established in the circuit, *"Cleared visual approach"* | *"Join right downwind runway 12"* | *"Join final runway 30"* |

All aircraft will arrive on runway **06L/24R** or **12/30**.

!!! note
    Circuit joining instructions given without an assigned altitude imply clearance to conduct the visual approach. Pilots may commence a visual approach while complying with any lateral instructions.

## IFR Operations
### Departures
IFR aircraft should expect to be issued with a SID as per below:

| Departure Direction | SID   |
| -------| ----- |
| South/West    | TONEG SID |
| North/North-west    | ISPET SID |
| East/North-east    | SCARP SID |

By day VMC, pilots may request a visual departure.

### Arrivals
STARs are available to segregate YPJT arrivals and YPPH traffic. Pilots may be cleared via a STAR or instructed to track direct to an IAF.

RNP approaches are available to RWY 06L, 24R, and 30. VOR and NDB approaches are available to the circling area.

By day VMC, pilots should expect to arrive in accordance with [VFR Arrivals](#arrivals_1).
