## Cairns (YBCS)
### Departures
VFR aircraft should expect to depart via a visual departure, on track to their first tracking point.

IFR aircraft should expect to be issued with a SID as per below:

| Aircraft Type | Runway | First Waypoint | SID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Jets | RWY 15 | AKROM | AKROM SID |
| Jets | RWY 33 | Any | EAZEE SID, Radar Transition |
| Non-Jets | RWY 15 | NONUM | NONUM SID |

All other aircraft shall expect the **CS (RADAR) SID**.

!!! note
    IFR non-jet aircraft may request a visual departure from ACD by day VMC.

### Arrivals
#### Instrument Approaches
An ILS is available to RWY 15. A LOC is available to RWY 33. RNP(AR) approaches are available to both runways.

IFR aircraft can generally expect to be processed via a STAR terminating with the following approach:

| Runway | Approach |
| --- | --- |
| 15 | ILS |
| 33 | RNP(AR) or LOC if unable |

#### Visual Approaches
By day VMC, IFR aircraft may be processed via the Creek Corridor to RWY 15 or via a circuit join to RWY 33.

The Creek Corridor is generally accessed from a Victor STAR. Details can be found on the **Noise Abatement Procedure Page 2** DAP chart. 

!!! phraseology
    *RXA5474 is tracking via the NONUM Victor STAR for runway 15.*  
    **CS TCU**: "RXA5474, cleared visual approach tracking via the Creek Corridor"  
    **RXA5474**: "Cleared visual approach via the Creek Corridor, RXA5474" 

By day VMC, aircraft may be processed via a visual right base for RWY 33 (from the north/east) or via a straight in visual approach (from the south/west). Aircraft via a right base can expect to track via the STAR or, if not assigned a suitable STAR, to track via **FCP**. CS TCU will likely assign the aircraft a visual altitude instruction and transfer them to CS ADC, who will issue the visual approach clearance.

!!! phraseology
    **CS TCU**: "JCI, track for a right base runway 33, descend to A020 visual"  
    **VH-JCI**: "Track for right base runway 33, descend A020 visual, JCI"  
    **CS TCU**: "JCI, contact Cairns Tower on 124.9"  
    **VH-JCI**: "124.9, JCI"  

    **VH-JCI**: "Cairns Tower, JCI, descending to A020 visual"  
    **CS ADC**: "JCI, Cairns Tower, cleared visual approach"  
    **VH-JCI**: "Cleared visual approach, JCI"

## Helicopter Operations
VFR helicopters may wish to operate to/from a floating pontoon helipad on the southeastern shore of the CBD, approximately 2nm from the RWY 33 threshold. This helipad is referred to as 'The Pier'.

Inbound helicopters must establish contact with **CS ADC** and request clearance to The Pier. Outbound helicopters must establish contact with **CS ADC** prior to becoming airborne and request clearance for their desired tracking.

!!! phraseology
    **VH-YZM**: "Cairns Tower, helicopter YZM, at The Pier, for Green Island, received F, request cleaerance"  
    **CS ADC**: "YZM, cleared to Green Island, not above A010, squawk 0455, report airborne"  
    **VH-YZM**: "Cleared to Green Island, not above A010, squawk 0455, YZM"  
    
    **VH-YZM**: "YZM, airborne"

## Reef Flights
VFR aircraft intending to conduct scenic flights over the reef shall do so in accordance with `SP11 - Great Barrier Reef - Cairns Scenic Flights`, found in the ERSA Special Procedures document.

Aircraft shall enter the area at Green Island, flying in an anti-clockwise flow to exit the area at Upolu Cay. Aircraft should operate at the following altitudes:

| Aircraft Type | Outbound Altitude | Inbound Altitude |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fixed Wing | A015 to Green Island | A010 from Upolu Cay |
| Rotary Wing | A005 until 12DME CS, then A010 to Green Island | A005 from Upolu Cay |

### Return to YBCS
Aircraft intending to track from Upolu Cay to YBCS shall do so in accordance with [SP11](#reef-flights).

Rotary wing aircraft shall track from Upolu Cay direct to YBCS at A005, remaining OCTA until in receipt of an airways clearance from **CS ADC**.

Fixed wing aircraft shall track in accordance with the table below:

| YBCS Duty Runway | Tracking from Upolu Cay |
| --- | --- |
| RWY 15 | Direct to Yorkeys Knob at A010, then as directed by ATC |
| RWY 33 | Direct to Gate A (see SP11), then Cape Grafton at A010 |
 
## VFR Corridors
Details of each corridor are available on the Cairns VTC.

### Eastern VFR Corridor
The Eastern VFR Corridor allows access to YBCS from the south. Aircraft shall remain OCTA and contact **CS ADC** for clearance via the corridor. Outbound VFR aircraft may request clearance via the corridor to track to the south.

!!! note
    Delays should be expected when RWY 33 is in use at YBCS. Alternate tracking via the Western VFR Corridor or Cape Grafton should be utilised in these situations.

### Western VFR Corridor
The Western VFR Corridor allows transit of the CS CTR without climbing above the escarpment. Aircraft shall remain OCTA and contact **CS ADC** for clearance via the corridor. 

Due to YBCS operations, aircraft may be issued with a clearance limit and instructed to sight & maintain own separation with other aircraft operating in the vicinity. Pilots must not proceed past a nominated clearance limit until in receipt of an onwards clearance.
