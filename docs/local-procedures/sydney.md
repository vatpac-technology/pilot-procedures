## Sydney (YSSY)
### Taxiing
#### Standard Taxi Routes
Standard Taxi Routes are utilised at Sydney to simplify taxi instructions and provide a streamlined movement of aircraft. Except where other explicit taxi instructions are given, pilots shall follow the routes described below.

!!! warning "Important"
    SMC may provide instructions which contradict these standard taxi routes. Ensure you comply with any issued taxi instruction at all times.

    Regardless of the taxi route used, all runway crossings require a specific clearance.

| Taxiway | Direction of Travel |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| **B** | Northbound |
| **C** | Southbound |
| **B10** | Eastbound (except holding point for 34L) |
| **L** | Westbound |

[Arrivals on RWY 16L/34R](#runway-16l34r-procedures) shall follow standard taxi routes when vacating the runway.

| Landing Runway | Route |
| --- | --- |
| **RWY 16L** | T, L |
| **RWY 34R** | T2, U, U1, L, or<br>U1, L |

Additional standard taxi routes exist into and out of some domestic aprons.

#### Runway 16L/34R Procedures
RWY 16L/34R is controlled by a separate ADC position (SY-E_TWR) which covers the duties of both SMC and ADC east of taxiway C and south of B10.

In line with Australian radio-telephony procedures, only international aircraft will receive an explicit transfer from SMC to ADC, and vice versa. When taxiing to RWY 16L/34R, domestic aircraft shall contact ADC when turning onto taxiway B10.

[Standard taxi routes](#standard-taxi-routes) exist for aircraft to utilise after landing on RWY 16L/34R, which should be performed without prompting by ADC.

Inbound aircraft must remain on the TWR frequency until west of Taxiway S, then contact SMC on 121.7. International aircraft will be issued with an explicit frequency transfer.

!!! warning "Important"  
    When taxiing westbound on TWY L, all aircraft must hold short of TWY C until in receipt of onwards taxi instructions from SMC.

### Departures
During PROPS, pilots can expect to be assigned a departure runway in accordance with the table below.

| Runway | Departure Conditions |
| ------ | -------------------- |
| RWY 16R | Departures to the S, W, and NW, and departures from the INTL terminal |
| RWY 16L | Departures to the N and E |
| RWY 34L | Departures the W, NW, and non-jets to the S, and departures from the INTL terminal |
| RWY 34R | Departures to the N and E, and jet departures to the S |

!!! note 
    Aircraft which operationally require RWY 16R/34L or RWY 07/25 must notify ATC at Clearance Delivery stage. Aircraft up to and including A330/B787/B772 may request RWY 16L/34R at Clearance Delivery stage.

Jet departures to the south may be assigned RWY 16L ad-hoc for traffic management purposes.

VFR aircraft should expect a visual departure, on track to their first waypoint.

**All Non-Jet IFR aircraft should expect the SY3 Radar departure**, and will generally depart on a Standard Assignable Heading as per the table below.

All IFR Jet aircraft should expect a SID in correlation with their assigned runway according to their direction of flight, as per the table below.

!!! note  
    ATC may issue IFR jet departures the SY3 Radar SID for traffic management or weather purposes. In this case, IFR aircraft assigned the SY3 departure will generally depart on a Standard Assignable Heading as per the table below.


| Runway | Jet | Non-Jet |
| ------ | --- | ------- |
| RWY 07 | H070 | H020, H110 |
| RWY 25 | H300, H240 | H020, H210, H240 |
| RWY 16L | H125 | H125 (RWY 25 in use), H090 (RWY 25 not in use) |
| RWY 16R | H170 | H210|
| RWY 34L | H290| H230 |
| RWY 34R | H030, H070 | H350|

| Aircraft Type | Runway | First Waypoint | SID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| All | All | Any | SY3 SID |
| Jets | 07 | OLSEM, WOL, Other | FISHA9 SID |
| Jets | 16L | WOL | ABBEY3, KEVIN7 SID |
| All | 16L | OLSEM, NOBAR, DIPSO, EVONN, CAWLY, OPTIC, Other | KEVIN7 SID |
| All | 16R | WOL, KADOM, RIC, Other | GROOK1 SID |
| Jets | 34L | RIC, Other | RIC6 SID |
| Jets | 34L | KADOM<br>WOL | KADOM1<br>WOL2 SID |
| Jets | 34R | WOL, Other | MARUB7 SID |
| Jets | 34R | OLSEM | OLSEM1 SID |

!!! note 1  
    The KEVIN7, GROOK1, RIC6, and MARUB7 SIDs all function as procedural and RADAR SIDs. ATC may elect to assign these SIDs to Jet aircraft in lieu of the SY3.

!!! note 2  
    The ABBEY3 SID will only be assigned during SODPROPS. During regular operations, jet departures via WOL using RWY 16L should expect KEVIN7 with a RADAR transition.

ATC may nominate RWY 16L for all jet departures via WOL instead of an ad-hoc basis. This will be informed via ATIS as "DOMESTIC JET DEPARTURES VIA WOL EXPECT RWY 16L".

#### Runway 34L Intersection Departures
Intersection departures on RWY 34L are approved for NON-JET aircraft from all taxiways South of B10 (including B10).

Jet aircraft are not permitted intersection departures when using RWY 34L. For VATSIM purposes, ATC may omit this requirement.

#### Pushback Towbar Disconnect Points
While seldom used at Sydney, ATC may instruct aircraft to push and tow forward to a specific towbar disconnect point.

!!! warning "Important"  
    ATC will avoid giving towbar disconnect points unless necessary, as maps are not available and the towbar points are not commonly used.

- consider changing 34L intersection departures wording. not sure if it comes off as too harsh or just right.
- debate keeping push disconnect points. they're seldom used and the only maps that have them are FDPro and stirling's gsx profile.

### Arrivals
ILS, GLS, and RNP approaches are available to all runways.

The Independent Visual Approach (IVA) is available to Runways 16L/R and 34L/R.

IFR aircraft shall be processed via a STAR terminating with vectors to final, excluding the MARLN5/25 and BOREE4P/16R arrivals, which terminate at their appropriate IAF.

The BOREE4P arrival will not be assigned regularly, unless ILS PRM approaches are in use on RWY 16L/R.

- anything to add?
- not sure what our stance is on BOREE4P, since we can't simulate PRM on VATSIM efficiently. technically we can simulate PRM but not the use of the PRM controller position. if it doesn't fit, we can remove it.

### Preferred Runway Exits
The AIRPORT EFFICIENCY PROCEDURES chart (ASA), or AIPORT BRIEFING 10-1P and 10-1P1 (Jeppesen) dictate preferred runway exits for aircraft to vacate at. To ensure minimum runway occupancy time and support optimum spacing on final, whenever operational conditions permit, pilots should plan to vacate via the exit taxiways specified in the table below:

| RWY | Aircraft Type | Preferred TWY Exits |
| --- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| 07 | Non-Jet<br>Jet except A388, B748, A346, B773<br>A388, B748, A346, B773 | B<br>D<br>G4 |
| 25 | Non-Jet<br>Jet | B<br>Y |
| 16L | Non-Jet<br>Jet | T3<br>T3, T4 |
| 16R | Domestic Terminal - All Types<br>International Terminal - All Types | B7<br>A4 |
| 34L | Domestic Terminal - All Types<br>International Terminal - All Types | B9<br>A2 |
| 34R | Non-Jet<br>Jet | T2<br>U1

!!! note  
    Non-Jet aircraft preferring to vacate North of TWY B7 must advise ADC prior to receiving a landing clearance.

### Sydney Director
Sydney Director (SY-D_APP & SY-DE_APP) is a position within the SY TCU that is responsible for providing vectors to final for inbound aircraft.

When assigned the Independent Visual Approach, you must report your assigned runway in sight (if you are visual with it) as soon as you are visual. In optimum VMC conditions, you would have your runway in sight on first contact.

Director will generally issue pilots with an estimate of their track miles remaining to aid in descent planning. This distance is from the current aircraft position to the assigned runway threshold. In most cases, this number will range from around 20 to 35 nautical miles. 

!!! phraseology  
    **VOZ853**: "Director, Velocity 853, descending 6000, Runway 34L in sight."  
    **SY-D_APP**: "Velocity 853, Director, descend 3000, 25 miles to run."

The airspace that director owns is very small and often heavily congested. It is imperative that pilots fly their assigned instruction without delay. Pilots will be issued vectors to final, speed restrictions, and altitude instructions that must be flown accurately and as soon as you receive them. Even a 5 second delay or erroneous heading input could cause conflict with another aircraft or throw you out of the sequence.

Director may issue complicated instructions as they instruct you to join final. These instructions are required by phraseology standards to ensure pilots will intercept the approach and not pass through the assigned runway centreline.

In the event of radio congestion on the base leg, do not pass through your assigned runway centreline. Commence the turn to enable intercept of the final approach course for the runway assigned, then track the extended centreline of that runway. If pilots do not receive a handoff to TWR by 4nm from the threshold, you may switch to the TWR frequency without an explicit handoff.

### YSSY STAR Route Discontinuities
Due to the nature of operations at YSSY, STARs that track to TESAT will contain a discontinuity in the FMC. Do not delete the route discontinuity from the FMC, as you will generally receive vectors before this point. Deleting the discontinuity will cause the aircraft to circle around TESAT instead of fly the last heading. 

Instead, pilots should follow the routing as labeled on the chart (generally, TRACK xxx TO TESAT. EXPECT RADAR VECTORS TO FINAL APPROACH COURSE AFTER xxxxx). You will generally receive vectors before overflying TESAT unless otherwise advised by ATC.

!!! warning "Important"  
    Some aircraft FMCs may insert a discontinuity after BOOGI, NASHO, or JAKLN. In most cases, these waypoints are followed by a point titled (VECTORS). If your FMC generates a discontinuity instead of a VECTORS waypoint, do not delete the discontinuity. They will function the same.

### Independent Visual Approaches (IVAs)
The Independent Visual Approach (IVA) is an approach procedure used at Sydney during simultaneous parallel runway operations. Aircraft can conduct visual approaches to parallel runways, without requiring staggered separation from aircraft operating on the adjacent approach. IVAs can only be conducted on parallel runways. Depending on the meteorological conditions, IVAs can be initiated from a circuit or from an instrument approach once the pilot is visual.

IVAs will only be conducted when the cloud base is greater than 3000ft, and the visibility is greater than 5000m. If the cloud base is between 2000ft and 3000ft, ATC will nominate instrument approaches into Independent Visual Approaches.

To fly the IVA, pilots must report their assigned runway in sight to ATC. If established on the LOC, pilots may report visual instead.

!!! note  
    "Reporting the runway in sight" means that you can and will maintain visual reference to the runway. If there is cloud or weather on your anticipated track that will obscure your visibility of the runway, do not report the runway in sight until you are certain you can maintain adequate visual reference to the runway.

To aid in intercepting the final approach course or glide path for the assigned runway, pilots should use the ILS or GLS for lateral and vertical guidance. 

!!! note 1  
    Pilots may be instructed to intercept the LOC without a full approach clearance. This does not constitute an approach clearance. You must intercept the localiser, but must not descend below your assigned altitude until you are cleared for an ILS, GLS, or IVA. The phraseology for an IVA will include "Cleared Independent Visual Approach".

!!! note 2  
    Only Australian and New Zealand operators are permitted to join an IVA from a circuit leg. International flights and Heavy or Super (H/J) category aircraft must first be established on the LOC or GLS FAC before being cleared for an IVA.

In the event of a missed approach, you must fly the published missed approach in accordance with the published instrument approach chart for your assigned runway, unless otherwise directed by ATC.

Ensure you do not overshoot your assigned runway centreline. Due to the close spacing of both parallel runways, passing through your assigned runway centreline can cause a breakdown or loss of separation with aircraft operating on the adjacent final. Fly accurate headings when being vectored to final. The vector to final will not be greater than 30 degrees from the runway centreline.

Pilots must manage their speed on the base leg to ensure they do not overshoot the centreline. ATC approach speeds apply, and can be found on the instrument approach chart.

When being cleared for an IVA at night, ATC will issue an additional instruction in your approach clearance. This instruction provides a minimum altitude to descend to until established on either the ILS/GLS glidepath or the PAPIs.

!!! phraseology  
    **SY-D_APP**: "Ambulance 282, Turn right heading 330, join final, from that heading cleared Independent Visual Approach RWY 34R, not below 1500 until established on the PAPI."  

Other aircraft will be operating on the adjacent approach, and ATC will provide surveillance or vertical separation until cleared for an IVA. Traffic information will be provided if another aircraft is within 1NM on final. Pilots must respond to any TCAS alert accordingly.

If an aircraft is observed to be deviating towards the adjacent final, ATC will issue a warning to the pilot.

!!! phraseology  
    **SY-D_APP**: "Qantas 452, you are deviating from the final approach course. Turn right immediately and return to your cleared approach,"  

This instruction is time-critical and pilots should immediately return to their approach.

If an aircraft is observed to penetrate, or is likely to penetrate the adjacent final, ATC will issue a break-out alert to the non-deviating aircraft.

!!! phraseology  
    **SY-D_APP**: "Break-out alert, Jetstar 891, turn right immediately, heading 100, climb to 3000."  

Break-out alerts are extremely time-critical, and must be hand-flown to avoid wasted time with autopilot inputs. Fly the plane first, then once established away from the centreline, respond to ATC.

- not sure what our stance is on break-out alerts. included because it seems worthy of including, especially with how often people seem to deviate from final...
- possisbly omitting the aus/nz operators requirement from IVAs. not sure how many controllers actually simulate that / what our stance on it is.

### Helicopter Operations
Helicopter procedures at Sydney are promulgated using coded designators and clearances for routes regularly flown by helicopters operating in SY terminal airspace.

The routes are identified by geographical designators and a direction which must be used in all radio communication. Clearance via a route authorises a pilot to fly the route at the altitudes specified. Clearances are used for all flights both inbound and outbound from YSSY, or within designated geographical areas within the control zone. If landing at YSSY, a frequency transfer and clearance limit are specified. ATC may amend the alitutes as required.

!!! note  
    If the instruction "MAINTAIN..." is included, the descent clearance included within the designated clearance is cancelled.

When operating via GEORGES RIVER 5, and not landing or departing YSBK, pilots must contact BK ADC 132.8 when tracking within 3NM of the BK CTR.

Departing and arriving helicopters will not receive a takeoff or landing clearance unless operating on H1. Instead, you will be asked to "report airborne/on the ground".

#### Helicopter Inbound Procedures
Procedures promulgated in *AIP ENR 1.1* for operations within helicopter access corridors apply.

Arriving helicopters shall contact ATC approximately 5 minutes before the prescribed entry gate and advise intentions. For the following designated routes, pilots must contact Sydney Centre (SRI) (or an appropriate terminal control frequency if SRI is offline):

| Route | Direction |
|---------|---------------------|
| BONDI 5 | SOUTH or NORTHBOUND |
| ROSEHILL 5 | INBOUND |
| ERSKINVILLE 5 | INBOUND |
| HARBOUR BRIDGE 5 | INBOUND |
| BARRACKS 5 | INBOUND |
| MAROUBRA 5 | INBOUND |

!!! phraseology  
    **XWY**: "Sydney Departures, helicopter XWY, 1000ft, received Delta, request Harbour Bridge 5 Inbound."  
    **SY TCU**: "XWY, squawk 0552."  
    **SY TCU**: "XWY, identified, cleared Harbour Bridge 5 Inbound."  
    **XWY**: "Cleared Harbour Bridge 5 Inbound, XWY."  

!!! note 1  
    Contact TWR at the frequency transfer point, unless advised otherwise.

!!! note 2  
    For CAPE BANKS 5 INBOUND, pilots must contact TWR 124.7 (or 120.5 if East TWR is not operating) for airways clearance.  
    For WANDA 5 INBOUND, pilots must contact TWR 120.5 for airways clearance.

For helicopters tracking via CAPS or MRBR, pilots should anticipate processing via a different inbound route due to YSSY runway configuration and traffic or sequencing requirements.

#### Helicopter Outbound Procedures
Procedures promulgated in *AIP ENR 1.1* for operations within helicopter access corridors apply.

Helicopters departing YSSY shall contact ACD, advise intentions, and request clearance for all designated routes.

!!! warning "Important"
    Receipt of a clearance **does not** constitute a takeoff clearance.

The table below shows which frequency to contact for a takeoff clearance **when departing from the heliport**.

| Frequency | Route |
| --------- | ----- |
| TWR 120.5 | ROSEHILL 5 OUTBOUND<br>WANDA 5 OUTBOUND<br>GEORGES RIVER 5 OUTBOUND<br> |
| TWR 124.7 | ERSKINEVILLE 5 OUTBOUND<br>HARBOUR BRIDGE 5 OUTBOUND<br>BARRACKS 5 OUTBOUND<br>MAROUBRA 5 OUTBOUND<br>CAPE BANKS 5 OUTBOUND |

For detailed route structures and operating requirements, refer to *ERSA FAC YSSY*.

#### BONDI 5 Coded Clearances
The BONDI 5 coded clearance is designed principally for single engine helicopters. Delays may occur when RWY 07 is in use for departure, or when RWY 25 is in use for arrivals. The route is not available in either direction when PRM approaches are in use in the RWY 16 direction. In addition to the ATC frequency, pilots should maintain a listening watch on 120.8 for information on traffic operating on the VICTOR ONE (V1) route.

Helicopters will be identified and then cleared for the BONDI 5 NORTHBOUND or SOUTHBOUND. Traffic information will be provided on any other helicopters operating on the route or for any other aircraft in the area (e.g. aircraft in the V1).

!!! phraseology  
    **XVZ**: "Sydney Approach, helicopter XVZ, Jibbon Point, 500ft, received Whiskey, request BONDI 5 Northbound."  
    **SY TCU**: "XVZ, Sydney Approach, squawk 0451."  
    **SY TCU**: "XVZ, identified, cleared BONDI 5 Northbound, Sydney QNH 1024."

Once you leave CTA (Long Bay Headland for Southbound, Sydney Heads for Northbound), ATC will cancel your control and identification services.

If ATC believes you are likely to request a clearance via one of Sydney's helicopter routes, you may be instructed to continue squawking your assigned code.

!!! phraseology  
    **SY TCU**: "XVZ, clear of controlled airspace. Identification and control services terminated, squawk 1200, frequency change approved."  

- add image detailing copter routes from ATC SOPs unless we want to make a different one

## Camden (YSCN)
### Airspace
CN ADC is responsible for the Class D airspace within the Camden CTR (Defined as 2nm radius YSCN) from SFC to 2000ft.

Outside TWR hours, airspace reverts to Class G. CTAF procedures apply.

### Taxiing
Refer to the diagram for the manoeuvring, apron, and movement areas.  

The runup bays are located within the manoeuvring area and therefore require taxi clearance.

Aircraft are expected to use the runup bays, therefore no explicit taxi clearance or onwards clearance is required from the runup bays.

On first contact with CN SMC, advise aircraft position and departure intentions.

Start approval is required for all flights intending to operate in the circuit area.

!!! phraseology  
    **WKM**: "Camden Ground, Citabria WKM, at the fuel bowser, received information Echo, request start up and taxi for circuits."  
    **CN SMC**: "WKM, Camden Ground, start approved, taxi to holding point E, Runway 24."

Aircraft above 5700kg MTOW must only use TWY D between RWY 06/24 and TWY F.

- attach CASA diagram of aerodrome movement area maps (will provide when i can figure out how to add images)

### Departures
Departures shall advise their intentions with their ready call. 

!!! phraseology
    **WKM**: "Camden Tower, WKM, holding point Echo, Ready Runway 24, circuits."  
    OR  
    **VMS**: "Tower, VMS, holding point Echo, Runway 24, ready for crosswind departure."

All departing aircraft shall depart and climb to `A013`.

Tower will often issue "Depart on climb" instructions to aircraft leaving the CTR. This gives the pilot permission to leave the CN CTR on climb vertically as well as laterally.

VFR aircraft departing into Class G airspace depart the CTR on an extended leg of the circuit. Clearance for VFR aircraft to operate in the CN CTR and VFR aircraft departing into Class G will be issued on CN TWR frequency.

Left hand circuits are required for powered aircraft operating RWY 06 and RWY 10.  
Right hand circuits are required for powered aircraft operating RWY 24 and RWY 28.

All aircraft departing the CTR into Class G airspace are to change to an appropriate SY TCU frequency when leaving the CTR. Specific transfer instructions will not be issued to VFR aircraft.

Aircraft, other than gliders and tugs, must not infringe the glider circuit below 2300ft.

### Arrivals
Arriving VFR aircraft should track via and report at BRY, MYF, MEG, PIC, or THK.

Arriving aircraft shall enter the circuit descending to or maintaining 1800ft.

When arriving via a VFR inbound point, pilots should expect the following circuit instructions:

| VFR Inbound Point | RWY 06 | RWY 24 |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------ |
| BRY | "Join downwind RWY 06, maintain 1800ft, report 2NM" | "Join final RWY 24, maintain 1800ft, report Oran Park (ONPK)" |
| MYF | "Join base RWY 06, maintain 1800ft, report 2NM" | "Join base RWY 24, maintain 1800ft, report 2NM" |
| MEG | "Overfly Camden to join mid-field crosswind RWY 06, maintain 1800ft, report overhead" | "Overfly Camden to join mid-field crosswind RWY 24, maintain 1800ft, report overhead" |
| PIC | "Overfly Camden to join mid-field crosswind RWY 06, maintain 1800ft, report overhead" | "Overfly Camden to join mid-field crosswind RWY 24, maintain 1800ft, report overhead" |
| THK | "Join final RWY 06, maintain 1800ft, report 3NM" | "Join downwind RWY 24, maintain 1800ft, report 2NM" |

ATC may omit the requirement to maintain 1800ft if pilots report inbound for a full stop and instead clear the pilot for a visual approach.

ATC may also omit the instruction if the circuit is not busy and a pilot reports inbound for touch and goes.

!!! phraseology  
    **MWY**: "Camden Tower, Citabria MWY, inbound via MYF, descending 1800, received Golf, for a full stop."  
    **CN ADC**: "MWY, Camden Tower, join base for Runway 24, maintain 1800, report 2 miles."  
    **MWY**: "Join base Runway 24, maintain 1800, report 2 miles, MWY."  
    **MWY**:, "MWY, 2 miles."  
    **CN ADC**: "MWY, cleared visual approach."

!!! phraseology  
    **RRW**: "Camden Tower, Citabria RRW, inbound via MEG, 1800, received Golf, for circuits."  
    **CN ADC**: "RRW, Camden Tower, overfly to join mid-field crosswind runway 24, report overhead."  
    **RRW**: "Join mid-field crosswind and report overhead, RRW."  
    **RRW**: "RRW, overhead, touch and go."  
    **CN ADC**: "RRW, cleared touch and go."

### Glider Operations
Glider aircraft and their towplanes will utilise two independent grass glider runways on the Southwestern side of the aerodrome. Both glider runways are parallel to either main runway.

Right hand circuits are required for gliders and tugs operating on glider strips 06 and 10. 

Simultaneous operations from both parallel glider strips. **Contra circuits are in use at all times. There is no dead side with contra circuits.**

Glider and tug circuits are flown to the South or Southeast, other aircraft circuits to the North or Northwest.

Outside the lateral limits of CN CTR, gliders operate throughout the surrounding and overlying Class G airspace.

ATC responsibilities to aircraft engaged in gliding activity are limited to passing relevant traffic information after the intention to land has been notified.  
The normal requirements on entry to the CTR do not apply to gliders. Gliders must report entering the CTR and downwind.

!!! warning "Caution"
    Gliders landing on glider strip 28 cross RWY 28 threshold.  
    Aircraft operating on RWY 10 are not visible to aircraft departing glider strip 06.  
    Aircraft on RWY 24 and on final for RWY 24 are not visible to aircraft on RWY 28.  
    Aircraft on RWY 28 and on final for RWY 28 are not visible to aircraft on RWY 24.  
    When RWY 06 or 24 in use, gliders and tailwheels may require strips 10 or 28 due to crosswind component.  
    Helicopters may conduct low level operations in the Southwest corner of the aerodrome.

### Helicopter Operations
Helicopter altitude is 1000ft on CN QNH HJ; 1300ft CN QNH HN.  
During HJ, helicopters must use the helicopter circuit which is established inside the fixed wing circuit.  
During HN, helicopters must conform to the fixed wing circuit.

### IFR Operations & Instrument Approaches
During TWR hours, IFR aircraft will receive an airways clearance from CN SMC or ADC.

The only instrument approach at YSCN is the RNP-W approach. This approach commences OCTA and enters the CN CTR.

SY TCU **will not** clear aircraft for the approach and will transfer aircraft to CN ADC at SCNWI. CN ADC shall issue airways clearance on first contact in accordance with the table below:

| Scenario | Clearance |
| -------- | --------- |
| Aircraft is visual and circuit traffic exists | "Cleared RNP-W approach, not below 1800ft" |
| Aircraft not visual or no circuit traffic | "Cleared RNP-W approach, Runway 06/24" |

## Richmond (YSRI)
### Airspace
When RI ADC is active, Restricted Areas R469, R470, and R494 are automatically activated.

RI ADC administers the R470 restricted area when active from SFC to 1500ft. ST TCU (SDN) administers it from 1500ft to 4500ft.

### VFR Procedures
All VFR aircraft inbound, outbound, or transiting the field maintain 1500ft.

Aircraft transiting the RIC CTR track via the northbound or southbound VFR route.  
Aircraft transiting northbound contact RI ADC at NPBR for clearance. Aircraft transiting southbound contact RI ADC at KRMD for clearance.

Further details of the transit route are found in the *ERSA FAC YSRI* and *Sydney VTC*.

#### Training Areas
There are three training areas located within R470, used for both civil and military operations.

| Name | Identifier | Vertical Limits |
| ---- | ---------- | --------------- |
| Londonderry Training Area | LDD TA | ``SFC - A015`` |
| Northern Training Area | NTA TA | ``SFC - A060`` |
| Southern Training Area | STA TA | ``SFC - A040`` |

#### Circuit Operations
The YSRI circuit area is defined as within 6nm of the YSRI ARP. An aircraft operating in the circuit will be issued a clearance to operate not above 1500ft. Both runways fly a left hand circuit.

### Departures
IFR aircraft planned via ANKUB, KADOM, or MUDGI may be assigned the SID that terminates at the appropriate waypoint. Aircraft that are not planned via these points, are flying VFR, or are negative RNAV, may be assigned a visual departure.

### Arrivals

### Tower Closed Procedures

- complete YSRI arrivals and tower closed procs

## VFR Scenic Flights
### Harbour Scenic Flights
The airspace above Sydney Harbour is Class C and availability of an airways clearance to enter it will depend on traffic levels, controller workload, and VMC. 

Pilots should submit a flightplan beforehand to minimise delays.

You may be cleared for one of two standard scenic flight routes, 'Harbour Scenic ONE', or 'Harbour Scenic TWO', which are described below.  
Both routes are flown at 1500ft on SY Local QNH, which is available through the SY ATIS.

!!! warning "Important"
    VFR flights do not receive a separation service in Class C airspace. Pilots must maintain their own separation with other aircraft operating in R405 and flying the Harbour Scenic.  
    ATC will provide basic traffic information.

#### Airways Clearance Requests
Track via Class G airspace to Long Reef. Contact Sydney Centre 124.55 (or an appropriate ATC frequency) prior to reaching Long Reef and request a 'Harbour Scenic'.  
Pilots must remain in Class G airspace until in receipt of a clearance.

**Harbour Scenic One**  
At 1500ft, track Long Reef direct to the Harbour Bridge.  
Remain east of the Harbour Bridge and commence a left turn, remaining north of the Opera House.  
Conduct 2 left orbits, remaining east of the Harbour Bridge, north of the Opera House, and west of Garden Island.  
On completion of the second orbit, track via North Head to Manly Beach. From Manly Beach track east of the coast to Long Reef. Report passing Manly northbound.

**Harbour Scenic Two**  
At 1500ft, track Long Reef direct to Chatswood CBD.  
Conduct 2 left orbits, remaining east of the Chatswood CBD and west of the Roseville Bridge.  
On completion of the second orbit, track to Manly Beach. Report passing Manly northbound.

#### Entry into V1 South Following a Harbour Scenic
Pilots may request descent into **Victor 1 South** approaching Manly Beach.  
Subject to traffic, and when established east of the coast, you may be cleared to leave the control area on descent.  
Report to ATC leaving 1500ft then broadcast your position and intentions on 120.8.  

!!! warning "Important"
    In aircraft with a single radio you will need approval to leave the ATC frequency to make this broadcast.

You must reach 500ft before passing South Head southbound.  
Report to ATC when established at 500ft in **Victor 1 South**.

Expanded details and diagrams are available in the *Sydney General Flying Guide*.  

- not sure if SRI is the frequency to list under airways clearance or not. realistically it'd be terminal to assign the appropriate frequency, but we could substitute that with SRI?
- diagrams potentially?

### Victor One
Transit of the Sydney area is available via a VFR Coastal Route within the Class G airspace east of the Sydney CTR and CTA. The route comprises **Victor 1 NORTH** and **Victor 1 SOUTH** which are differentiated by the lower limits of the overlying Class C airspace and by their tracking requirements.  
The Coastal Route is depicted on the SY VTC and Sydney General Flying Guide (SGFG). It may be flown in either direction, however operations are restricted to VMC by day only.

Pilots are required to use SY Local QNH, available on the SY ATIS. If transponder equipped, squawk code 1200 with ALT.  
The carriage and use of radio is mandatory to fly the V1.  
Operations along the Coastal Route share a common VHF frequency (120.8) with helicopter and floatplane operations in R405A and R405B along Sydney Harbour.

Pilots should broadcast joining the Coastal Route, stating position and intentions. Pilots of opposite direction aircraft should respond with position and intentions.  
Landing lights and strobe lights should be activated and pilots should be alerted for opposite direction traffic.  
If possible, keep opposite direction traffic on your left.

**Victor 1 South** extends East of the coast between the South East of Sydney Harbour and Jibbon Point (the Southern Headland of Port Hacking) and includes three coastal HLS at Wanda Beach, Cape Baily and Cape Banks.  
Pilots are required to maintain an altitude of exactly 500ft on Sydney Local QNH when operating in this airspace.  
Pilots must contain their aircraft in Class G airspace and remain clear of the SY CTR.  
To avoid the SY CTR, you must NOT Coastal Fly the Sydney Southern beaches between Ben Buckler (the Northern headland of Bondi Beach), and fly East in a straight line between the Eastern most point of Cape Banks and the lighthouse on Cape Solander (the North and South heads of Botany Bay).  
Some helicopters may have been cleared to coastal fly between Bondi and Maroubra and may not continuously monitor the CTAF.

The CTA lower limit south of Jibbon Point and East of the coast is 1000ft. North of Jibbon Point, the lower limit is 500ft.

**Victor 1 North** extends east of the coast between Dee Why (12DME SY) and the South Head of Sydney Harbour and has a maximum altitude of 1000ft on SY Local QNH.  
All operations in Victor 1 North must be conducted between 500ft and 1000ft. Operations below 1000ft must remain over water at all times.

South Head is the northern limit of **Victor 1 South** and pilots should ensure that their aircraft remains clear of Class C airspace when transiting from **Victor 1 North** to **Victor 1 South**. Ensure that you reach 500ft before passing South Head southbound.

- possibly change 120.8 freq requirement? not sure if we'll be including this freq with the CTAF introduction nor if we support its use currently.

### R405 (Sydney Harbour) Airspace
R405 is established for use by seaplanes and helicopters with MTOW not above 2,500kg or that adhere to specific noise standards.

All aircraft operating in R405 are to squawk 1200. 

Helicopter transit and access lanes are established within R405A and B, details of which are provided below. Helicopter operations within R405A and B must be confined to the helicopter lanes, and seaplanes must be confined to transit lanes, for operations other than climb or descent to landing sites immediately adjacent to the lanes.

Military helicopters above 2,500kg MTOW may transit R405B East of Fort Denison over water, not above 1000ft on SY QNH for access to military establishments within R405.

Seaplanes may operate in R405 A and B as follows:  
over water at all times;  
within R405A not above 500ft on SY QNH;  
within R405B not above 1000ft on SY QNH;  
not use any helicopter access lane.

Aircraft are to broadcast intentions entering and leaving R405 on frequency 120.8. This frequency is not monitored by ATC.

Entry and departure into R405B from and to the east must be made over water via Sydney Heads. Transit from V1 overland into R405B is not permitted.

#### Helicopter Transit and Access Lane Procedures
The altitude specified for each lane shall be maintained during lane transit.  
Pilots shall keep to the right when flying along a helicopter lane.  
All helicopter routes shall be flown on SY local QNH.

For further information regarding helicopter lanes, refer *ERSA FAC YSSY*. The table below gives an outline of the lane routing.

| Access Lane | Routing | Altitudes |
| ----------- | ------- | --------- |
| Harbour Lane | Follow Parramatta River from Silverwater to Ryde Road Bridge, Gladesville Bridge, the Southern Pylon of Sydney Harbour Bridge, abeam Bradley's Head, abeam Middle Head, Sydney Heads and thence coastal to Long Reef. The lane is over water. | Not below ``A007`` on QNH from Silverwater to Ryde Road Bridge; ``A005`` on QNH between Ryde Road Bridge and the Harbour Bridge; ``A010`` on QNH between the Harbour Bridge and Middle Head, climb and descent to be conducted East of the Harbour Bridge. Not above ``A010`` on QNH, over water, between abeam Middle Head and Long Reef. |
| Lane Cover River Lane | Access Lane from Gladesville Bridge to Pennant Hills via Northern Suburbs Cemetary, follows the Lane Cove River Valley to Pennant Hills. | ``A005`` on QNH between Gladesville Bridge and Delhi Rd; ``A007`` on QNH between Delhi Rd and Pennant Hills. |
| North Shore Lane | Access Lane for the HLS near the Royal North Shore Hospital/Channel 9/Channel 2 is shown on the diagram. | ``A010`` on QNH. |

- same as V1 procs, not sure what our stance is on 120.8 and if we should subsitute it with 122.8 or not.
- add helicopter transit & access lane proc diagrams from ERSA or other source (if it exists).

### Helicopter Coded Clearances
#### Terminal Airspace Sector Coded Clearances
