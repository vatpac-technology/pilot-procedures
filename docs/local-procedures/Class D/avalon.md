## Departures
VFR aircraft should expect to depart via a visual departure, on track to their first tracking point or via an extended leg of the circuit.

IFR aircraft should expect to be issued with a SID as per below:

| Aircraft Type | Runway | First Waypoint | SID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| All | All | ML | JUSTY SID |

Aircraft planned to the northeast via a waypoint other than ML can expect to be *rerouted* via ML and cleared via the JUSTY SID. All other aircraft shall expect the **AV (RADAR) SID**.

## Arrivals
An ILS is available to RWY 18. RNP and VOR approaches are available to both runways. An RNP(AR) approach is available to RWY 36.

IFR aircraft can generally expect to be processed via the JAYBI STAR, or direct to the IAF, terminating with the following approach:

| Runway | Approach |
| --- | --- |
| 18 | ILS |
| 36 | RNP(AR) or RNP if unable |

## Tower Closed Procedures
When AV ADC is closed, the AV CTR is reclassified as Class G from `SFC` to `A007`. Class E airspace begins at `A007`.

### Outbound
Departing aircraft will require an airways clearance on the ground, due to the low level of CTA. Aircraft should report taxiing to the TCU controller, who will issue a squawk code and traffic statement. These aircraft should be instructed to report at the holding point, where airways clearance will be issued.

!!! phraseology
    **AM318**: "Melbourne Approach, AM318, King Air, POB 2, IFR, taxiing YMAV runway 18 for YMEN"  
    **ML TCU**: "AM318, Melbourne Approach, squawk 3542, no reported IFR traffic, report ready at the holding point for airways clearance"  
    **AM318**: "Squawk 3542, wilco, AM318"  
    
    **AM318**: "AM318, ready runway 18"  
    **ML TCU**: "AM318, cleared to YMEN direct. Enter controlled airspace on the AV5 departure, climb via SID to `A040`"  
    **AM318**: "Cleared to YMEN direct. Enter controlled airspace on the AV5 departure, climb via SID to `A040`, AM318"  
    **ML TCU**: "AM318, assigned heading left 020, report airborne"  
    **AM318**: "Assigned left 020, wilco, AM318"

### Inbound
Due to the low level of CTA above Avalon, aircraft conducting approaches will commence the approach inside controlled airspace and leave CTA on descent. If the aircraft goes around, they will re-enter controlled airspace.

!!! note
    A clearance to conduct an instrument approach constitutes a clearance to carry out the published missed approach, including re-entering CTA.

!!! phraseology
    **ML TCU:** "JST607, leave controlled airspace descending via the ILS Runway 18 approach, no reported IFR traffic, report clear of the runway"  
    **JST607:** "Leave controlled airspace descending via the ILS Runway 18 approach, JST607"  

    **JST607:** "JST607, clear of the runway, Avalon, cancel SARWATCH"  
    **ML TCU:** "JST607, Avalon SARWATCH terminated"
