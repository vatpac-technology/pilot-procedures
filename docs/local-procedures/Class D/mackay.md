## Terminal Airspace
**MK ADC** is responsible for the Class D airspace within the MK CTR from `SFC` to `A010`. **MKA** is responsible for the MK Keyhole airspace from `SFC` to `F150` (excluding MK ADC's jurisdiction).

### Tower Closed Procedures
When MK ADC is closed, MKA or KPL may choose to either extend top down to YBMK, or reclassify the Class D airspace from `SFC` to `A007` as Class G and `A007` to `A045` as Class E. Check for a Zulu ATIS to confirm the airspace arrangement.
