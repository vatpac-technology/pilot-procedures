## Terminal Airspace
**MK ADC** is responsible for the Class D airspace within the MK CTR from `SFC` to `A010`. **MKA** is responsible for the MK Keyhole airspace from `SFC` to `F150` (excluding MK ADC's jurisdiction).

### Tower Closed Procedures
When MK ADC is closed, MKA or KPL may choose to either extend top down to YBMK, or reclassify the Class D airspace from `SFC` to `A007` as Class G and `A007` to `A045` as Class E. Check for a Zulu ATIS to confirm the airspace arrangement.

## Departures
VFR aircraft should expect to depart via a visual departure, on track to their first tracking point.

IFR aircraft should expect to be issued with a SID as per below:

| Aircraft Type | Runway | First Waypoint | SID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| All | All | CLIFT | CLIFT SID |
| All | All | MUNAR | MUNAR SID |

All other aircraft should expect the **MK (RADAR) SID**.

## Arrivals
RNP and VOR approaches are available to both runways. A VOR and NDB approach is available to the circling area.

IFR aircraft can generally expect to be processed via a STAR, or direct to the IAF, for the most suitable (or requested) approach.
