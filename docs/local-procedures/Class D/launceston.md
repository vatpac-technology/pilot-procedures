## Terminal Airspace
**LT ADC** is responsible for the Class D airspace within the LT CTR from `SFC` to `A015`. **LTA** is responsible for the airspace within a 30nm radius of the LT VOR from `SFC` to `F245` (excluding LT ADC's jurisdiction).

When LT ADC is closed, LTA or HUO may choose to either extend top down to YMLT, or reclassify the Class C & D airspace from `SFC` to `A085` as Class G. Check for a Zulu ATIS to confirm the airspace arrangement.

**HBA** may choose to extend to cover **LTA**.

## Departures
VFR aircraft should expect to depart via a visual departure, on track to their first tracking point. A number of VFR reporting points exist to facilitate inbound and outbound tracking.

IFR aircraft should expect to be issued with a SID as per below:

| Aircraft Type | Runway | First Waypoint | SID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| All | All | IRSOM | IRSOM ALPHA SID |
| All | All | MIKIS | MIKIS SID |
| All | All | MORGO | MORGO SID |
| All | All | TASUM | TASUM SID |
| All | All | VEKLO | VEKLO SID |
| All | RWY 32L | FLIKI | FLIKI ALPHA SID |
| All | RWY 32L | MOTRA | MOTRA ALPHA SID |
| All | RWY 32L | NUNPA | NUNPA ALPHA SID |
| All | RWY 32L | VIMAP | VIMAP ALPHA SID |
| All | RWY 14R | FLIKI | FLIKI BRAVO SID |
| All | RWY 14R | MOTRA | MOTRA BRAVO SID |
| All | RWY 14R | NUNPA | NUNPA BRAVO SID |
| All | RWY 14R | VIMAP | VIMAP BRAVO SID |
| Non-Jets | RWY 14R | MORGO | MORGO CHARLIE SID, *by pilot request only* |
| Non-Jets | RWY 14R | IRSOM | IRSOM CHARLIE SID, *by pilot request only* |
| Non-Jets | RWY 14R | FLIKI | FLIKI CHARLIE SID, *by pilot request only* |

All other aircraft shall expect to be *rerouted* in accordance with the table above, or assigned the **LT (RADAR) SID**.

By day VMC, pilots may request or be assigned a **visual departure**.

## Arrivals
An ILS is available to RWY 32L only. RNP & VOR approaches are available to both runways.

IFR aircraft can generally expect to be processed via a visual approach where suitable, otherwise to be rerouted to the IAF for the RNP approach.

Aircraft from the north for RWY 32L can expect amended tracking in accordance with the table below:

| Via | Routing |
| --- | --- |
| IRSOM | NODAS MLTSC |
| NUNPA | ELREL MLTSA |

### MSA
The VOR and ILS approach to RWY 32L commence from either overhead the VOR or from a straight in position. The straight in IAF has a commencement altitude *below* the MSA. Pilots can expect a clearance to descend not below the DME steps to reach the IAF, then in accordance with the assigned approach. Pilots cleared in this manner must reference the **DME OR GNSS ARRIVAL** chart until they are established on the assigned approach.
