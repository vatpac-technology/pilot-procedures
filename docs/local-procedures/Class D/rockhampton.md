## Terminal Airspace
**RΚ ADC** is responsible for the Class D airspace within the ΡΚ CTR from `SFC` to `A010`. **RΚΑ** is responsible for the RK Keyhole airspace from `SFC` to `F150` (excluding RK ADC's jurisdiction).

### Tower Closed Procedures
When RK ADC is closed, RKA or KPL may choose to either extend top down to YBRK, or reclassify the Class D airspace from `SFC` to `A007` as Class G and `A007` to `A045` as Class E. Check for a Zulu ATIS to confirm the airspace arrangement.
