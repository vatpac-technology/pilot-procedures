## Terminal Airspace
**RΚ ADC** is responsible for the Class D airspace within the ΡΚ CTR from `SFC` to `A010`. **RΚΑ** is responsible for the RK Keyhole airspace from `SFC` to `F150` (excluding RK ADC's jurisdiction).

### Tower Closed Procedures
When RK ADC is closed, RKA or KPL may choose to either extend top down to YBRK, or reclassify the Class D airspace from `SFC` to `A007` as Class G and `A007` to `A045` as Class E. Check for a Zulu ATIS to confirm the airspace arrangement.

## Departures
VFR aircraft should expect to depart via a visual departure, on track to their first tracking point.

IFR aircraft should expect to be issued with a SID as per below:

| Aircraft Type | Runway | First Waypoint | SID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| All | All | BUDGI | BUDGI SID |
| All | All | TARES | TARES SID |

All other aircraft should expect the **RK (RADAR) SID**.

## Arrivals
RNP and VOR approaches are available to both runways. A VOR and NDB approach is available to the circling area.

IFR aircraft can generally expect to be processed via a STAR, or direct to the IAF, for the most suitable (or requested) approach.
