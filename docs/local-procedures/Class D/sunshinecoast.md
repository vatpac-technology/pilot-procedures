## Airspace
SU ADC is responsible for the Class D Airspace within the SU CTR and surrounding Class D airspace from `SFC` to `A045`.

### Tower Closed Procedures
When SU ADC is offline, the Class D airspace reverts to Class G. CTAF procedures apply. The Class C airspace from `A045` and above remains active and is administered by INL.

## Departures
VFR aircraft should expect to depart via a visual departure, on track to their first tracking point.

IFR aircraft should expect to be issued with a SID as per below:

| Aircraft Type | Runway | First Waypoint | SID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Jets | All | MOOLO | MOOLO SID |
| Jets | All | TAPET | TAPET SID |

All other aircraft shall expect a visual departure.

## Arrivals
An RNP, and RNP(AR) is available for all runways.

IFR aircraft can generally expect to be processed via a STAR terminating with the following approach:

| Runway | Approach |
| --- | --- |
| RWY 13 | RNP(AR) or RNP if unable |
| RWY 31 | RNP |

## Runway Configuration
The runway layout at YBSU has changed over the years. Pilots with old simulators/scenery may not have the newer Runway 13/31 config (replacing the old 18/36 config). If your scenery does not feature this updated runway configuration, you must inform ATC, who will try to facilitate your flight as best as possible.
