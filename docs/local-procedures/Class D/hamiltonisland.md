### Tower Closed Proceedures
When HM ADC is closed, the Class D airspace from `SFC` to `A045` is reclassified as Class G.

## Departures
VFR aircraft should expect to depart via a visual departure, on track to their first tracking point.

IFR aircraft shall expect to depart via a [pilot-managed](../../navigation/ifrdepartures.md#other-departure-methods) IFR departure or **visual departure**.

## Arrivals
RNP and RNP(AR) approaches are available to both runways.

IFR aircraft can generally expect to be processed direct to the IAF for the most suitable (or requested) approach.
