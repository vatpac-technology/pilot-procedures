## Terminal Airspace
**HB ADC** is responsible for the Class D airspace within the HB CTR from `SFC` to `A015` to the north of the runway centreline and `SFC` to `A025` to the south. **HBA** is responsible for the airspace within a 35nm radius of TASUM (and a portion of the airspace to the north) from `SFC` to `F245` (excluding HB ADC's jurisdiction).

### Tower Closed Proceedures
When HB ADC is closed, HBA or HUO may choose to either extend top down to YMHB, or reclassify the Class C & D airspace from `SFC` to `A085` as Class G. Check for a Zulu ATIS to confirm the airspace arrangement.

**LTA** may choose to extend to cover **HBA**.

## Hobart (YMHB)
### Departures
VFR aircraft should expect to depart via a visual departure, on track to their first tracking point or via a designated VFR route.

IFR aircraft should expect to be issued with a SID as per below:

| Aircraft Type | Runway | First Waypoint | SID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| All | All | KANLI | KANLI SID |
| All | All | LATUM | LATUM SID |
| All | All | RIBLI | RIBLI SID |
| All | RWY 12 | LAVOP | LAVOP SID |

All other aircraft shall expect to be *rerouted* in accordance with the table above, or assigned a **visual departure**.

During low traffic periods, an [IFR departure via other methods](../../navigation/ifrdepartures.md#other-departure-methods) may be available on pilot request to facilitate tracking to a position not serviced by a SID. At other times, pilots can expect to be rerouted and issued a SID, then cleared in accordance with their filed route once above the MSA.

### Arrivals
An ILS is available to RWY 12 only. RNP, RNP(AR) & VOR approaches are available to both runways.

IFR aircraft can generally expect to be processed via a STAR terminating with the following approach:

| Runway | Approach |
| --- | --- |
| 12 | ILS or RNP(AR) |
| 30 | RNP(AR) or RNP if unable |

## Cambridge (YCBG)
### Airspace
YCBG sits inside the Hobart Class D control zone. When **HB ADC** is online (or **HBA**/**HUO** are extending top down), clearances are required for all aircraft operations.

**HB ADC** (or the most appropriate controller) is responsible for the Class D airspace from `SFC` to `A015` to the north of the YMHB runway centreline and `SFC` to `A025` to the south. They do *not* have jurisdiction over the runways or taxiways at YCBG.

### Departures
Prior to leaving the apron, all outbound aircraft must establish communications with **HB SMC** (or the most appropriate controller) for airways clearance.  

All IFR aircraft can expect to be assigned a **visual departure** or one of Hobart's **Procedural SIDs**.

!!! note
    Both VFR and IFR aircraft require a clearance to operate in Class D airspace (even if this is an implied clearance to depart a leg of the circuit).  The examples below show an IFR aircraft departing.

!!! phraseology
    **NDR**: "Hobart Ground, NDR, for Devonport, request clearance"  
    **HB SMC**: "NDR, cleared to Devonport via KANLI flight plan route, KANLI3 departure, climb via SID to A045, squawk 4432"  
    **NDR**: "Cleared to Devonport via KANLI flight plan route, KANLI3 departure, climb via SID to A045, squawk 4432, NDR"

When ready to taxi and prior to leaving the apron, aircraft must contact **HB ADC**, advising intended runway for departure and receipt of YMHB ATIS, to obtain traffic information.

!!! phraseology
    **NDR**: "Hobart Tower, NDR, taxiing Cambridge Runway 32, received Hobart Information D"  
    **HB ADC**: "NDR, no reported IFR traffic, report ready"  
    **NDR**: "Wilco, NDR"

Takeoff clearances are not given. Aircraft must remain clear of the active runway and report ready to HB ADC. Aircraft must not enter an active runway or become airborne until departure instructions have been issued.

!!! phraseology
    **NDR**: "NDR, ready"  
    **HB ADC**: "NDR, report airborne"  
    **NDR**: "Wilco, NDR"

### Arrivals
Inbound aircraft who are tracking via the HBA CTA will be given an airways clearance by HBA and transferred to ADC. Aircraft entering the Hobart CTR directly from Class G should contact HB ADC directly for clearance. Aircraft should expect to be instructed to join a leg of the circuit and cleared for a visual approach (traffic permitting).  In IMC, IFR aircraft will fly one of Hobart's instrument approaches until visual, then break off to circle to land.

A landing clearance will not be given. Pilots can expect to receive traffic information on any relevant aircraft and instructed to report clear of the runway.

!!! phraseology
    *UJA is an IFR Aero Commander who has been cleared the YMHB RNAV-Z RWY 30 approach by HBA and handed off to HB ADC.*  
    **UJA:** "Hobart Tower, UJA"  
    **HB ADC:** "UJA, Hobart Tower, report visual"  
    **UJA:** "Wilco, UJA"  

    **UJA:** "UJA, visual"  
    **HB ADC:** "UJA, track for final runway 30, no reported traffic, report clear of the runway"  
    **UJA:** "Track for final runway 30, wilco, UJA"

!!! phraseology
    *KLR is a VFR Cherokee who is tracking inbound on the Victor East VFR route.*  
    **HB ADC:** "KLR, enter the control zone tracking via the Victor East, A015, clearance limit Sorell"  
    **KLR:** "Enter control zone tracking via the Victor East, A015, clearance limit Sorell, KLR"  

    **KLR:** "KLR, approaching Sorell"  
    **HB ADC:** "KLR, join base runway 12, cleared visual approach, no reported traffic, report clear of the runway"  
    **KLR:** "Join base runway 12, cleared visual approach, wilco, KLR"

## VFR Routes
VFR aircraft inbound to and outbound from both YMHB and YCBG should plan via the published VFR routes.

!!! tip
    Each route is described in the YMHB ERSA FAC entry and shown on the Hobart VTC.

| Victor    | Inbound       | Outbound        | 
| --------- | -------------- | ---------------- | 
| Northwest |  CBV-CPA-RCH west of the Colebrook/Richmond Road to west abeam RADT  | West abeam RADT-RCH-CPA-CBV west of the Richmond/Colebrook Road    | 
| Northeast |  CBV-CPA-Orielton-SORL east of Colebrook Road to CPA then Orielton east of Tasman HWY to SORL |  As directed by ATC to SORL then Orielton east of Tasman HWY, thence east of Colebrook Rd east of CPA to CBV   | 
| East      |  DLY-SORL north of the Arthur HWY        |  As directed by ATC to SORL   | 
| Southwest |  DRP to-YCBG west of Mt Rumney        |  Eest of Mt Rumney to DRP        | 
| South     |  CREM-LAUD-YCBG            |  LAUD-CREM          |

!!! phraseology
    **NDR:** "Hobart Tower, NDR, CPA, A015, on the Victor Northwest, received Romeo, request clearance"  
    **HB ADC:** "NDR, enter the CTR tracking via the Victor Northwest at A015."
