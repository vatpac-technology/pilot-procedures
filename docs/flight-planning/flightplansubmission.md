- don't have to submit a flight plan for everything (e.g. circuits, VFR OCTA, etc) but it helps if you intend on talking to ATC or flying near CTA

## Equipment Codes

## Callsigns
- Note to use ICAO not IATA codes
- Use of VH- for international flights only, otherwise just 3 character rego identifier
- Include unusual callsigns in remarks as 'RTF/QANTAS'
- List of approved callsigns (mirror what we have in the SOPs under Controller Skills)

## Airwork and Planned Delays
- 'DLE/YMAV0020'
- 'RMK/AV ILS'
- 'RMK/HARBOUR SCENIC ONE'
