--8<-- "includes/abbreviations.md"

When not identified on Radar or ADSB, pilots must provide position reports to update ATC on their location. This can be expected at low altitude in remote areas, and over the ocean. ATC will tell aircraft when they are identified, usually immediately upon departure.

!!! note "Format"
