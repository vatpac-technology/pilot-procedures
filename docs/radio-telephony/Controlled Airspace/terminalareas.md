## Class C
### First Contact
On first contact with a terminal controller (generally 'Approach' or 'Departures'), **inbound** aircraft must report their assigned level, in-flight conditions, and the ATIS identifier.

!!! note "Format"
    "*(ATC Unit)*, *(Callsign)*, *(Cleared Level)*, [Visual], received *(ATIS Code)*"

!!! example
    "Sydney Approach, QFA426, descending to A090, received Delta"

On first contact with a terminal controller, **outbound** aircraft must report their passing level, assigned level, and assigned heading/departure instructions (if applicable).

!!! note "Format"
    "*(ATC Unit)*, *(Callsign)*, [*(Departure Instructions)*], passing *(Passing Level)*, climbing to *(Assigned Level)*"

!!! example
    "Melbourne Departures, QLK78D, turning right heading 320, passing A023, climbing to A050"

### SIDs/STARs
Aircraft on a SID/STAR will generally be given climb/descent instructions using *'climb via SID to (Level)'* and *'descend via STAR to (Level)'* phraseology. Pilots must readback the instruction exactly as it is issued. Once all height/speed restrictions have been passed, controllers may use traditional climb/descent phraseology.

!!! warning "Important"
    If an aircraft is cleared via a SID or STAR and the controller issues a climb or descent without the *'climb via SID'* or '*descend via STAR'* phraseology, this does **not** cancel any applicable SID/STAR restrictions. Pilots must continue to comply with all speed, level, and lateral tracking restrictions on the procedure.

!!! example
    "JST881, climb via SID to F280"

#### Cancelling Restrictions
Where a controller wishes to cancel the published altitude restrictions on a SID/STAR, they will use the following format.

!!! note "Format"
    "*(Callsign)*, cancel level restrictions"

Where a controller wishes to cancel the published speed restrictions on a SID/STAR, they will use the following format.

!!! note "Format"
    "*(Callsign)*, cancel speed restrictions"

### Approaches (TODO) - GEN page 282
- Cleared for instrument approach
- Cleared for instrument approach leaving CTA (YMAV, YSBK)
- Cleared for visual approach

## Procedural Class D
### Inbound Call
On first contact with a procedural approach unit (e.g. procedural towers), report your position, assigned level, in-flight conditions, and the ATIS identifer.

!!! note "Format"
    "*(ATC Unit)*, *(Callsign)*, *(Distance)* miles *(Aerodrome Name)*, *(GNSS Track/VOR Radial)*, *(Assigned Level)*, \[Visual], *(ATIS Code)*"

!!! example
    "YCFS Tower, RXA6416, 32 miles Coffs Harbour on the 189 radial, descending to A080, visual, received Oscar"

### Departure Report
Once established on your outbound track (or in compliance with your assigned departure procedure), report your departure to the tower controller.

!!! note "Format"
    "*(Callsign)*, tracking [*(Outbound Track)* or via *(SID)*], climbing to *(Assigned Level)*"

!!! example
    "RXA6417, tracking 203, climbing to A070"  

    "XEB, tracking via the DUGGI ONE departure, climbing to A070"

### Approaches
There is no difference in phraseology used to clear an aircraft for an approach in Class C or Class D airspace, however due to airspace and surveillance coverage constraints, the controller may issue additional report requirements and/or clear aircraft to leave and re-enter CTA on descent prior to commencing the approach.

See [Class C](#approaches) for radio phraseology.
