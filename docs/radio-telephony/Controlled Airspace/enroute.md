## Frequency Transfers
After being instructed to contact an adjacent ATC unit, you must report your assigned level.

!!! example
    "Melbourne Centre, QFA773, climbing to F280"

!!! note
    You should not report your *passing* level unless you have not yet been identified and you expect the new controller to have surveillance coverage at your position. The controller will ask you to verify your level in this case, so if in doubt, leave it out!

## STAR Clearance
When issued a STAR clearance, you must read it back in its entirety, including any assigned runway and level instruction.

!!! example
    **BLA**: "JST440, cleared LIZZI9A arrival, runway 16, maintain F380"  
    **JST440**: "Cleared LIZZI9A arrival, runway 16, maintain F380, JST440"

If you require a particular runway or approach, you should inform ATC *before* you receive your STAR clearance. The more notice, the better.

## Tracking Requests
### Route Deviation
In controlled airspace, you must obtain approval to deviate from your cleared route. For weather deviations, positioning the aircraft for the capture region of an instrument approach, or any other route deviation, request an appropriate distance left or right of route.

!!! note "Format"
    "<span class='placeholder'>Callsign</span>, request <span class='placeholder'>Distance</span> miles <span class='placeholder'>Left/Right</span> of route due <span class='placeholder'>Reason</span>"

!!! example
    **RXA6166**: "RXA6166, request 10 miles left of route due weather"  
    **GUN**: "RXA6166, cleared up to 10 miles left of route, report clear of weather"  
    **RXA6166**: "Cleared up to 10 miles left of route, RXA6166"

### Change of Level
Short, straight-forward requests like a change of level do not require a heads up to the controller.

!!! example
    **JST12**: "JST12, request climb to F400"  
    **KEN**: "JST12, climb to F400"  
    **JST12**: "Climb to F400, JST12"

### Amended Route
It is good practice to preface complicated or time consuming requests with some warning, so the controller can prepare themselves.

!!! example
    **VOZ850**: "VOZ850, request"  
    **ARL**: "VOZ850"  
    **VOZ850**: "VOZ850, request amended tracking via CFS, BNA, CG, thence YBBN, due operational requirement"  
    **ARL**: "VOZ850, recleared direct CFS, thence BNA, CG, YBBN, maintain F370"  
    **VOZ850**: "Recleared direct CFS, thence BNA, CG, YBBN, maintain F370, VOZ850"
