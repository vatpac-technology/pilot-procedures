## Taxi
Immediately prior to, or during, taxi at a Class G aerodrome, make a taxi report to the enroute or terminal controller managing the overlying controlled airspace.

!!! note "Format"
    "*(ATC Unit)*, *(Callsign)*, *(Aircraft Type)*, [*(Persons on Board)* POB], IFR, taxiing *(Location)* for *(Destination)*, runway *(Departure Runway)*"

    *POB is not required for scheduled air transport flights.*

!!! example
    "Melbourne Centre, RXA6588, SAAB 340, IFR, taxiing YORG for YPKS, runway 29"

    "Sydney Approach, FWC, Cessna 172, 3 POB, IFR, taxiing YWBN for YYNG, runway 35"

In response, ATC will likely issue a squawk code and traffic statement of any relevant nearby aircraft.

### Low Overlying CTA
Some aerodromes, particularly those in the capital city terminal areas or procedural towers where the tower is closed, have low overlying CTA steps which may be difficult to avoid on departure. In these situations, ATC will issue an airways clearance for aircraft planned into CTA prior to departure.

!!! example
    **QLK101D**: "Brisbane Centre, QLK101D, Dash 8, IFR, taxiing YCFS for YSSY, runway 21"  
    **INL**: "QLK101D, squawk 1202, no reported IFR traffic, report lined up for airways clearance"  
    **QLK101D**: "Squawk 1202, wilco, QLK101D"  

    **QLK101D**: "QLK101D, lined up"  
    **INL**: "QLK101D, cleared to YSSY via SORTI, flight planned route, climb to FL120"  
    **QLK101D**: "Cleared to YSSY via SORTI, flight planned route, climb to FL120, QLK101D"

## Departure
After taking off and setting course for your first tracking point, inform ATC of your departure. If you haven't already received an airways clearance, ensure that you stop your climb below the base of CTA.

!!! tip
    The CTA lower levels are displayed on ERCs and TACs.

The appropriate call depends on whether you expect to be identified or not. If in doubt, assume you are *not* identified.

In response, ATC will provide an airways clearance (where available), if not already issued.

### Identified
!!! note "Format"
    "*(Callsign)*, *(Position)*, passing *(Current Level)*, climbing to *(Requested Level)*, estimating *(First Waypoint)* at *(ETA)*"  

!!! example 
    "QLK101D, 3nm southwest of Coffs Harbour, passing A043, climbing to F180, estimating SORTI at 43"

### Not Identified
!!! note "Format" 
    "*(Callsign)*, departed *(Location)* *(Time of Departure)*, tracking *(Outbound Track)*, climbing to *(Requested Level)*, estimating *(First Waypoint)* at *(ETA)*" 

!!! example 
    "EWQ, departed YQLP 18, tracking 076, climbing to FL130, estimating CV at 51"

## Descent 
As you approach top of descent, ATC will provide a clearance to leave CTA (if required) and a traffic statement for your arrival, as well as the current area QNH.

!!! example
    **ISA**: "EWQ, when ready leave controlled airspace descending, no reported IFR traffic, area QNH 1021"  
    **EWQ**: "When ready leave controlled airspace descending, area QNH 1021, EWQ"

## Arrival
After landing at your destination, or where insufficient radio coverage exists on the ground, at a suitable time during your arrival, report your arrival to ATC and cancel your SARWATCH.

!!! note "Format"
    "(Callsign), (Location), cancel SARWATCH"

!!! example
    **EWQ**: "EWQ, Charleville, cancel SARWATCH"  
    **ISA**: "EWQ, Charleville SARWATCH terminated"

SARWATCH termination is not required to be read back by the pilot. Once your SARWATCH has been terminated, your flight has finished in the eyes of ATC. No further services will be provided to you.

## Enroute Requests
When established outside of controlled airspace, there is no requirement for authorisation to change your flightpath. However, when operating IFR, you must obtain traffic information on any change you will shortly commence, to ensure that doing so doesn't cause conflict with other aircraft.

!!! note "Format"
    "*(Callsign)*, request traffic for *(intended change)*"

!!! example
    **FWC**: "FWC, request traffic direct ARMWD"  
    **ARL**: "FWC, no reported IFR traffic"

    **LKU**: "LKU, request traffic for climb to A060"  
    **ARL**: "LKU, no reported IFR traffic"
