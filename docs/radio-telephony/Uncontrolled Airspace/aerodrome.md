## ATS Frequency
### Taxi
Immediately prior to, or during, taxi at a Class G aerodrome, make a taxi report to the enroute or terminal controller managing the overlying controlled airspace.

!!! note "Format"
    "*(ATC Unit)*, *(Callsign)*, *(Aircraft Type)*, [*(Persons on Board)* POB], IFR, taxiing *(Location)* for *(Destination)*, runway *(Departure Runway)*"

    *POB is not required for scheduled air transport flights.*

!!! example
    "Melbourne Centre, RXA6588, SAAB 340, IFR, taxiing YORG for YPKS, runway 29"

    "Sydney Approach, FWC, Cessna 172, 3 POB, IFR, taxiing YWBN for YYNG, runway 35"

In response, ATC will likely issue a squawk code and traffic statement of any relevant nearby aircraft.

#### Low Overlying CTA
Some aerodromes, particularly those in the capital city terminal areas or procedural towers where the tower is closed, have low overlying CTA steps which may be difficult to avoid on departure. In these situations, ATC will issue an airways clearance for aircraft planned into CTA prior to departure.

!!! example
    **QLK101D**: "Brisbane Centre, QLK101D, Dash 8, IFR, taxiing YCFS for YSSY, runway 21"  
    **INL**: "QLK101D, squawk 1202, no reported IFR traffic, report lined up for airways clearance"  
    **QLK101D**: "Squawk 1202, wilco, QLK101D"  

    **QLK101D**: "QLK101D, lined up"  
    **INL**: "QLK101D, cleared to YSSY via SORTI, flight planned route, climb to F120"  
    **QLK101D**: "Cleared to YSSY via SORTI, flight planned route, climb to F120, QLK101D"
