## ATS Frequency
### Taxi
Immediately prior to, or during, taxi at a Class G aerodrome, IFR aircraft must make a taxi report to the enroute or terminal controller managing the overlying airspace.

!!! note "Format"
    "<span class='placeholder'>ATC Unit</span>, <span class='placeholder'>Callsign</span>, <span class='placeholder'>Aircraft Type</span>, <span class='optional'>[<span class='placeholder'>Persons on Board</span> POB]</span>, IFR, taxiing <span class='placeholder'>Location</span> for <span class='placeholder'>Destination</span>, runway <span class='placeholder'>Departure Runway</span>"

    *POB is not required for scheduled air transport flights.*

!!! example
    "Melbourne Centre, RXA6588, SAAB 340, IFR, taxiing YORG for YPKS, runway 29"

    "Sydney Approach, FWC, Cessna 172, 3 POB, IFR, taxiing YWBN for YYNG, runway 35"

In response, ATC will likely issue a squawk code and traffic statement of any relevant nearby aircraft.

#### Low Overlying CTA
Some aerodromes, particularly those in the capital city terminal areas or procedural towers where the tower is closed, have low overlying CTA steps which may be difficult to avoid on departure. In these situations, ATC will issue an airways clearance for aircraft planned into CTA prior to departure.

!!! example
    **QLK101D**: "Brisbane Centre, QLK101D, Dash 8, IFR, taxiing YCFS for YSSY, runway 21"  
    **INL**: "QLK101D, squawk 1202, no reported IFR traffic, report lined up for airways clearance"  
    **QLK101D**: "Squawk 1202, wilco, QLK101D"  

    **QLK101D**: "QLK101D, lined up"  
    **INL**: "QLK101D, cleared to YSSY via SORTI, flight planned route, climb to `F120`"  
    **QLK101D**: "Cleared to YSSY via SORTI, flight planned route, climb to `F120`, QLK101D"

#### Poor Radio Reception
Where poor radio reception precludes establishing contact with ATS on the ground, report airborne to commence your SARWATCH service.

!!! note "Format"
    "<span class='placeholder'>ATC Unit</span>, <span class='placeholder'>Callsign</span>, airborne <span class='placeholder'>Location</span>"

After establishing contact, [report your departure](enroute.md#departure).

!!! example
    **IBU**: "Melbourne Centre, IBU, airborne YMRY"  
    **WOL**: "IBU, squawk 3277, no reported IFR traffic"  
    **IBU**: "Squawk 3277, departed YMRY 44, tracking 340, climbing to `A080`, estimating ATGOD at 12, IBU"  
    **WOL**: "IBU, no reported IFR traffic for climb to `A080`, area QNH 1009"  
    **IBU**: "Area QNH 1009, IBU"

### Arrival
After landing at their destination, or where insufficient radio coverage exists on the ground, at a suitable time during their arrival, IFR aircraft must report their arrival to ATC and cancel their SARWATCH.

!!! note "Format"
    "<span class='placeholder'>Callsign</span>, <span class='placeholder'>Location</span>, cancel SARWATCH"

!!! example
    **EWQ**: "EWQ, Charleville, cancel SARWATCH"  
    **ISA**: "EWQ, Charleville SARWATCH terminated"

SARWATCH termination is not required to be read back by the pilot. Once your SARWATCH has been terminated, your flight has finished in the eyes of ATC. No further services will be provided to you.

## CTAF Frequency
When operating within, or approaching, the vicinity of a non-controlled aerodrome, you should tune the appropriate CTAF and make broadcast radio calls as deemed appropriate.

!!! note "Format"
    "<span class='placeholder'>Location</span> traffic, <span class='placeholder'>Callsign</span>, <span class='placeholder'>Message</span>, <span class='placeholder'>Location</span>"

You are only required to make a radio broadcast on a CTAF where you consider it necessary to avoid a collision with another aircraft. However, common sense would suggest that regular, structured broadcasts are the best way to mitigate potential conflict and aid other pilots in their situational awareness.

### Recommended Calls
It is recommended that you make a broadcast in the following situations:

- Immediately before, or during, taxi for departure
- Immediately before entering a runway
- When inbound to the CTAF, at a distance of 10nm or greater (especially for high performance aircraft)
- Immediately before joining the circuit
- For a straight in approach or instrument approach, established on not less than a 3nm final
- When clear of all runways after landing

!!! example
    "YMBA traffic, Cessna 172 UWA, 10nm north of the field, passing `A036` on descent, inbound, estimating the circuit area at 44, YMBA"

Pilots should reply to any received broadcast with their own position and intentions (and any other relevant information) where they deem potential for conflict.
