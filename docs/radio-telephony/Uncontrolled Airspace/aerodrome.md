## ATS Frequency
### Taxi
Immediately prior to, or during, taxi at a Class G aerodrome, make a taxi report to the enroute or terminal controller managing the overlying controlled airspace.

!!! note "Format"
    "*(ATC Unit)*, *(Callsign)*, *(Aircraft Type)*, [*(Persons on Board)* POB], IFR, taxiing *(Location)* for *(Destination)*, runway *(Departure Runway)*"

    *POB is not required for scheduled air transport flights.*

!!! example
    "Melbourne Centre, RXA6588, SAAB 340, IFR, taxiing YORG for YPKS, runway 29"

    "Sydney Approach, FWC, Cessna 172, 3 POB, IFR, taxiing YWBN for YYNG, runway 35"

In response, ATC will likely issue a squawk code and traffic statement of any relevant nearby aircraft.

#### Low Overlying CTA
Some aerodromes, particularly those in the capital city terminal areas or procedural towers where the tower is closed, have low overlying CTA steps which may be difficult to avoid on departure. In these situations, ATC will issue an airways clearance for aircraft planned into CTA prior to departure.

!!! example
    **QLK101D**: "Brisbane Centre, QLK101D, Dash 8, IFR, taxiing YCFS for YSSY, runway 21"  
    **INL**: "QLK101D, squawk 1202, no reported IFR traffic, report lined up for airways clearance"  
    **QLK101D**: "Squawk 1202, wilco, QLK101D"  

    **QLK101D**: "QLK101D, lined up"  
    **INL**: "QLK101D, cleared to YSSY via SORTI, flight planned route, climb to F120"  
    **QLK101D**: "Cleared to YSSY via SORTI, flight planned route, climb to F120, QLK101D"

## CTAF Frequency
When operating within, or approach, the vicinity of a non-controlled aerodrome, you should tune the appropriate CTAF and make broadcast radio calls as deemed appropriate.

!!! note "Format"
    "*(Location)* traffic, [*(Aircraft Type)*] *(Callsign)*, *(Message)*, *(Location)*"

You are only required to make a radio broadcast on a CTAF where you consider it necessary to avoid a collision with another aircraft. However, common sense would suggest that regular, structured broadcasts are the best way to mitigate potential conflict and aid other pilots in their situational awareness.

### Recommended Calls
It is recommended that you make a broadcast in the following situations:

- Immediately before, or during, taxi for departure
- Immediately before entering a runway
- When inbound to the CTAF, at a distance of 10nm or greater (especially for high performance aircraft)
- Immediately before joining the circuit
- For a straight in approach or instrument approach, established on not less than a 3nm final
- When clear of all runways after landing

!!! example
    "YMBA traffic, Cessna 172 UWA, 10nm north of the field, passing A036 on descent, inbound, estimating the circuit area at 44, YMBA"

Pilots should reply to any received broadcast with their own position and intentions (and any other relevant information) where they deem potential for conflict.
