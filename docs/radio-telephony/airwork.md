## Area of Operations
Pilots of aircraft receiving an identification service OCTA or operating in CTA, must inform ATS prior to conducting airwork.

It is generally easiest to nominate an area of operations with both a lateral and vertical limit. An ops normal time should be nominated to allow ATS to plan for the duration of your intended airwork.

!!! note "Format"
    "<span class='placeholder'>Callsign</span> will be conducting airwork within a <span class='placeholder'>Distance</span> radius of <span class='placeholder'>Position</span>, <span class='placeholder'>Altitude Block</span>, ops normal <span class='placeholder'>Time</span>"

!!! example
    **CYF**: "CYF will be conducting airwork within a 20nm radius of YBTH, SFC to A070, ops normal 45"  
    **GUN**: "CYF, copy ops normal 45, no reported IFR traffic"

In CTA, a clearance must be obtained prior to conducting airwork.

!!! example
    **OIT**: "OIT request airwork within a 5nm radius of PEGSU between A080 and A100 for the next 15 minutes"  
    **SAS**: "OIT, cleared to operate within a 5nm radius of PEGSU, A080 to A100"  
    **OIT**: "Cleared to operate within a 5nm radius of PEGSU, A080 to A100, OIT"

## Practice Instrument Approaches
The area of operations definition above is generally sufficient for conducting practice instrument approaches OCTA. In CTA, it is generally easier for ATC if you can provide more detail about the intendeed approach.

!!! example
    **UNF**: "UNF request the YSRI ILS approach runway 28 to the minima"  
    **SAS**: "UNF, turn right heading 360, expect ILS approach runway 28"  
    **UNF**: "Turn right heading 360, UNF"

    **SAS**: "UNF, turn left heading 310 to intercept the localiser, cleared ILS approach runway 28, report in the missed approach"  
    **UNF**: "Turn left heading 310 to intercept the localiser, cleared ILS approach runway 28, UNF"

### Onwards Clearances
When discontinuing an instrument approach, you must follow the published missed approach. If alternate tracking would be more desirable when conducting the missed approach, this should be communicated to ATS prior to commencing the approach.

!!! example
    **UNF**: "UNF, from the minima, request a visual left turn to YSBK at A015"  
    **SAS**: "UNF, I will advise"  

    **SAS**: "UNF, onwards clearance, from the minima, make left turn direct to YSBK, climb to A015 visual"  
    **UNF**: "From the minima, make left turn direct to YSBK, climb to A015 visual, UNF"

## Flight Plan Remarks
See [Flight Plan Submission](../flight-planning/flightplansubmission.md#airwork-and-planned-delays) for details on how to notify ATC of any intent to conduct airwork through your flight plan remarks.
