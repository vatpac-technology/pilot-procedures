## General Radio Tips
The key to a successful flight is often the smaller details, one of which being efficient, timely use of the radio. Pilots should strive to keep their radio calls as clear, concise, and standardised as possible.

At any one time, there may be over a dozen aircraft on frequency. If every pilot takes an *extra 5 seconds* to pass their message, that's an *entire minute* lost for the controller! Keep things short, clear, and by the book.

### Before Transmitting
It is important that you don't interrupt an ongoing conversation on frequency, which may require a station to transmit their message again, wasting time and preventing others from passing their own messages.

When switching to a new frequency, you should wait 3-5 seconds to ensure that another interaction is not taking place, then pass your message.

## Transmission of Numbers
### Callsigns
Numbers should be grouped in pairs, from right to left.

| Callsign | Phraseology | Logon Code |
| ------ | ---------- | ------- |
| Qantas 1 | Qantas one | QFA1 |
| Jetstar 23 | Jetstar twenty three | JST23 |
| Virgin Australia 844 | Velocity eight forty four | VOZ844 |
| Rex 6166 | Rex sixty one sixty six | RXA6166 |
| RA-Aus registered 24-5236 | Jabiru fifty two thirty six | R5236 |
| VH-FEK *(on flights within Australian FIR)* | Foxtrot Echo Kilo | FEK |
| VH-FEK *(on flights entering, leaving, or outside Australian FIR)* | Victor Hotel Foxtrot Echo Kilo | VHFEK |

!!! tip
    For a list of common operator radio designators, see [Operator Callsigns](operatorcallsigns.md).

When transmitting on a CTAF, the aircraft type should precede the callsign when making initial calls. When making an initial call on any frequency, helicopters should prefix their callsign with *'helicopter'*.

## Radio Checks
In response to a radio check, or when providing feedback on the quality of a transmission, the following scale is to be used.

| Value | Meaning |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Unreadable |
| 2 | Readable now and then |
| 3 | Readable but with difficulty |
| 4 | Readable |
| 5 | Perfectly readable |

## Reporting Requirements
Pilots are expected to make reports to ATC in the following scenarios:

### Controlled Airspace
- Ready to Taxi
- Airborne
- Position Report when not identified
- Updated Position Report, when previous estimate is more than **2 minutes** in error
- Sustained variation of more than **10kt** or **Mach 0.02** from any previously notified speed or any standard descent profile
- Aircraft performance is degraded
- Leaving a level
- Reaching an assigned level (if not identified)
- Unable to comply with ATC clearances or instructions

### IFR Aircraft in Class G Airspace
- Taxiing (or Airborne if no VHF coverage on ground)
- Departure
- Reaching cruising level (if not identified)
- Position Report when not identified
- Updated Position Report, when previous estimate is more than **2 minutes** in error
- Before changing level or any lateral deviations
- Before changing to CTAF and not monitoring ATS frequency on COM2
- Arrival, to cancel SARWATCH

## Readback Requirements
The following items are **mandatory** to read back to ATC:  

- An ATC Route Clearance in its entirety, and any amendments
- Holding instructions
- Any route and runway-holding position specified in a taxi clearance
- Any clearances, conditional clearances or instructions to hold short of, enter, land on, line-up on, wait, take-off from, cross, taxi or backtrack on, any runway or helipad
- Any approach clearance
- Any assigned runway or helipad
- Altimeter settings directed to specific aircraft (not general broadcasts)
- SSR (squawk) codes
- Level instructions (including *'via SID/STAR'* when this is part of the instruction), direction of turn, heading and speed instructions

!!! note
    This is the complete list of readback requirements. Anything not listed above is **not required** to be read back. Some examples of items that aren't required to be read back are:

    - Report requests by ATC
    - Traffic Statements
    - Runway/Approach Expectations
    - General broadcasts
