## Simulation of Emergencies
You are welcome to simulate a variety of emergencies in accordance with the VATSIM Code of Conduct, however during times of high workload, a controller may instruct you to cancel the emergency simulation or disconnect from the network.

!!! note "Reference"
    VATSIM Code of Conduct B6
    > No flight may declare itself to have priority over another. Pilots are permitted to declare in-flight emergencies only when under air traffic control. If, for any reason, air traffic control requests the pilot to terminate the emergency, then the pilot must do so IMMEDIATELY or disconnect from the network. 

It is up to the discretion of the pilot in command as to whether to declare a Pan Pan or Mayday. However, the majority of situations will warrant a Pan Pan.

### Examples of Emergencies
| Examples of Pan Pans | Examples of Maydays |
| -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Engine failure in a multi-engine aircraft | Uncontained engine fire |
| Depressurisation | Smoke in the cabin |
| Minor flight control problem | Major flight control problem |
| Medical emergency | VFR in IMC |
| Necessary weather avoidance in contradiction of ATC clearance | |
