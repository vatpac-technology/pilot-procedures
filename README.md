# VATPAC Pilot Procedures

The VATPAC Pilot Procedures site is an open-source collaborative project allowing members of the VATPAC community to work together to create high-quality reference-style procedures for pilots.

## Contributing

Contribution guidelines can be found within the project under [Assist Us](https://vatpac-technology.github.io/pilot-procedures/assist-us/). 

**Before contributing** you should liaise with the VATPAC ATS Team to ascertain whether that particular procedure is needed. There is a fine-line between enabling a realistic service, and making our procedures easy to navigate and understand.  

## Build and Deployment

This project uses some basic CI to automatically push the latest commits to the `main` branch to GitHub Pages. 

Because of this, all changes should be made as a Pull Request. This also ensures - 
  * That everybody has visibility of what you're working on, and can provide commit-by-commit commenting and review.
  * A much better method of version control, as most PR's will be squashed and merged into `main`.

## Project Control

The owner for this project is the ATS Director. Members of the ATS Team are also able to review PR's.
